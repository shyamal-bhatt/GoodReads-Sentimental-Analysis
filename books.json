        "Review 1": "I’m speechless after reading this bone chilling, dark, twisty, mind bending thriller which is one of the best works of Lisa Jewel.\n\nAfter reading a few pages, you find yourself drawn into riveting psychological thriller with unreliable characters, shocking revelations in podcast meets documentary blending in narration of incidents by hours and dates. It starts slow but the sinister feeling tingles beneath your neck, warning you bad things are about to come and sooner all hell breaks loose. So many red flags appear in your vision as you keep flipping the pages. At the second half, things get escalated! You barely hold your screams as more tragic events follow each other. It’s like listening to a concerto slowly raises its tempo and as you reach the ending, you hear the crescendo: that’s moment the earth shattering revelation squeezes your heart, you barely breathe!\n\n  I have so many words for the ending that are not enough to express my feelings. It’s heartbreaking, shocking, eerie, unsettling, disturbing! \n\nThe storyline revolves around two women who share the same birthday, were born in the same city, hospital, chose the same place to celebrate their 45th birthday. One of them is Alix Summers; famous podcaster promoting aspiring women who take their second changes for life to achieve bigger things. The other woman is Josie Fair, married with her husband two times older than her, mother of 2 daughters in twenties, a teen mother, who is unsatisfied with her life and her unaccomplished dreams. \n  On the other hand, Alix lives in her dream house, happily married, with two young children. Her husband’s late benders start to damage their marriage. She wants a distraction not to confront for her problems. \n  Josie is adamant to involve in Alix’s life, creating coincidences to bump into her around her children’s schoolyard. When Josie starts to tell her about her traumatic life, Alix thinks she already found the distraction she needed. Using Josie’s story who wants to make imminent changes in her life may attract her audiences’ attention. \n  But Josie seems like more than telling her story, lurking around Alix’s house, trying to be part of her life, criticizing her marriage.\nThe things Josie confesses during podcast recording scare the living daylights of Alix. Is Josie survivor of years long abuse, neglect, traumatic experiences? Could Alix help her birth twin for setting her free from her torturous life?\n Or did she invite trouble into her own house by accepting to make this podcast? \n  When Josie knocks her door in the middle of the night, Alix realizes things can get more out of control and nothing as it seems. \n\nOverall, it’s one of the stories that stay with you for years, still giving you goosebumps at each time you remember the characters and main events. It took my breath away! I think I’m not going to get peaceful sleep for a long time. The birthday twins’ story may haunt me forever!  Dear Lisa Jewel perfectly achieved to rock my world again! \n\nGiving my highly deserved five stars to this mind numbing, complex, highly sinister, perfectly developed and executed novel! \n\nSpecial thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for sharing this brilliant novels of digital copy in exchange my honest thoughts.\n\nIf you’re interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:\n\nmedium.com\ninstagram\nfacebook\ntwitter\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "4 1/2 stars. I want to start by saying: this was absolutely riveting. I inhaled this book. The only way the pages could have turned faster is if I had more hours in my day.\n\nThe reason I am not giving None of This Is True five stars, which I thought I would for 95% of the book, is that I feel conflicted about the ending. Maybe it is because I have certain expectations from Jewell at this point, and the ending here didn't fit with them... I just know that I wanted more from the final chapters. In a way, it felt unfinished. Could there be a sequel lined up?\n\nBut back to me gushing about the stuff I loved because this is a cracktastic ride.\n\nJewell throws together two women-- birthday twins, born on the same day in the same hospital -- from very different backgrounds. Alix Summer, with her seemingly perfect life as a podcaster and her seemingly perfect family in their beautiful house, and Josie, a woman from a council estate with a past filled with abuse, grooming and who-knows-what other horrors.\n\nWhen Josie proposes she be a guest on Alix's podcast to tell the story of her life, Alix is curious about this strange woman. Josie lets Alix into her life and history through the podcast and Alix, in turn, gradually lets Josie into her life too. But the more Alix comes to know Josie and her past, the more she worries she's made a terrible mistake.\n\nLots of short, punchy chapters, interspersed with a Netflix documentary and podcast extracts, all make for a very fast-paced read. You know bad shit has happened from the start, maybe reeeaaaaalllly bad shit, but I didn't have a clue what, exactly, had gone down, and I was desperate to find out.\n\nAlix's life is nowhere near as shiny as it appears on the surface and Josie is just a fascinating character. Peeling apart the layers of her backstory, discovering her childhood, her role as a mother, and the lies she has told, was pure heart-pounding fun!\n\nThe wait for Jewell's next book will be too long.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "None of This is True couldn’t be more apt for the title.Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, is out celebrating her forty-fifth birthday when she meets her birthday twin Josie Fair. She doesn’t think much more about it until she runs into Josie again outside her children’s school. One thing leads to another, and Josie convinces Alix they should make a podcast about Josie’s life, sharing her truth and making some big changes. Alix believes Josie has a compelling story to tell, even if she finds her unsettling and a bit intense. Things escalate quickly, and the two women’s lives become inextricably tied. If this book didn’t victim blame a thirteen-year-old girl, it would have been a four-star read. A teen is incapable (and inculpable) of holding any power over a creepy middle-aged man. I was engrossed in this story until Walter’s crimes were glossed over. It seems his repeated pedophilia was excusable because he was supposedly a good father. Can a pedo even be a good father? It doesn’t add up. Until this point, I found the story utterly compelling. I could feel Alix’s anxieties and Josie’s oppressive presence, but it all went downhill from there. The more I think about it, the worse it gets.",
        "Review 4": "Okay this is definitely an interesting ride. Two women living two totally different and separate lives are brought together in a pub on the same night because they share the same birthday. One of them is a nut job and the story goes from there. Different than most thrillers I’ve read, but I needed more from the ending! Solid 4",
        "Review 5": "I don't know how to feel about this 😵‍💫 (but I did binge it in one sitting)",
        "Review 6": "2.5⭐️ the best part of this book is that it's finally over\n\nMy work colleagues might fight me on this one on Monday 🤭 was the premise good? yes, very good actually. It was new and fun and twisty and I loved it.\n\nUnfortunately as the story progressed every character became less interesting. I thought oh wait but the storyline build-up is good so maybe there's still time to save the book. Guess what? it didn't save the book 😬 the last 20% was very anticlimactic and some twists just ruined the book for me.\n\n*** incoming minor spoiler\n...\nSo you want to tell me that every person was defending on a pedophile and the mc's mum is viciously angry because her 16 year old daughter seduced a 43 year old man who was married to another woman but having an affair with this little girl's mum? 😳😳😳\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Compared to Jewell's previous few books, I liked this one quite a bit better. Most of it anyway.\n\nNone of This Is True--but what is true and what isn't? That's the question I was asking myself throughout my reading.\n\nJosie and her husband are celebrating Josie's 45th birthday in a pub. At a table nearby, podcaster Alix is also celebrating her 45th birthday. Josie has a quiet, reserved, different type of life, and Alix seems to have everything Josie wants. The two meet and discover that they are \"birthday twins\" and this eventually involves Alix interviewing Josie for her podcast. Josie tells the tale of her life and Alix is shocked. But what is true? Is any of it?\n\nJewell's writing is strong and I was thoroughly invested. I could not stand Josie, but that was totally the point. The ending is interesting and really got me thinking. My recommendation is to just go into the reading of this book with an open mind and without any preconceived notions as to what you think is going on, because that will probably change many times throughout.\n\nThere were a few holes in the narrative and a few times that I thought the story could have been a bit tighter and less repetitive. However in the end I was able to overlook those factors and just go with it. \nAnd you have to be ready to set aside that a 13-15 year old CHILD cannot consent to a relationship regardless of how whackadoodle sociopathic she is. She just can't. And if Walter was turned on by that, then ew. If I had my MSW daughter read this she would say Josie's actions throughout the book all stemmed from that unresolved trauma and she wouldn't be wrong.\n\nDecent psychological suspense story that will provide a wild ride, so buckle up!\n\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "Trust Your Instincts\n\nNone of This is True is a psychological thriller about two women who, through a chance encounter, learn they are birthday twins. Their unlikely meeting turns into a podcast in which shared confidences become the motive for murder.\n\nMeet Josie Fair, a 45-year-old part-time seamstress. Married to a man significantly older, she has decided to change the course of her life in her 45th year. Alix comes into her life at just the right time--a podcast host, she is the perfect woman to help Josie share her intriguing story. Alix and Josie’s lives become intertwined in more ways than one, culminating in a chilling crime.\n\nChapters alternate between Josie and Alix. Josie is alluring, but she is also intense and odd. She is off-putting but enthralling at the same time. Her story is questionable, and I was waffling back and forth while reading this on her reliability. Alix’s chapters are not as interesting as Josie’s, but she adds a level of stability to the story.\n\nInterspersed between chapters are interviews filmed for a Netflix series called “The Birthday Twin.” These tidbits add another layer to the events, but the snippets don’t show the whole of the situation until the end when the truth is finally revealed.\n\nThis is an addictive page-turner that I couldn’t put down. Josie is a train wreck of a character that I couldn’t look away from. Her character is one of the reasons I enjoyed this novel. At the same time, themes include pedophilia, alcoholism, and physical and emotional abuse, so it is not a fun read. It is also dark, tense, suspenseful, and has some major creepy vibes. The ending gave me the chills.\n\nI haven’t loved Jewell’s most recent novels, but this one is back to form.\n\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Atria Books in exchange for an honest review.\n\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "It took me awhile to sort out my thoughts on this one, as it was not quite what I expected, but that isn’t a bad thing. I buddy read this with my sister Irina, and part of the reason I love reading the same book as a friend or friends is due to the fact that you can really hash out your book review content ahead of time. We both ended up with similar feelings on None of This Is True, and foremost agreed that it was a compulsive, must read suspense tale.\n\nLisa Jewell is an incredibly talented storyteller, as she can really take the odd day-to-day occurrences and entwine them with clear and concise character development, giving birth to novels that allow the reader to fully engage with the cast of characters, no matter if they are likable or despicable. This book is no different, and the multiple povs really give us insight into the various narrators inner thoughts and feelings while the tension ramps up around them. Josie and Alix couldn’t be more different; they come from different lifestyles and circumstances, and yet… Could they be more similar than originally meets the eye?\n\nNo spoilers, but there are some heavy themes discussed here. In fact, the build up of 85% of the novel is such a beautiful master class on slow burning suspense, and how to do it so that you don’t lose the reader in the process, that I was sure this would be Jewell’s darkest novel yet. The final 15% is what threw me for a loop. There are a few aspects that I had to overlook up until this point, behaviors and lack of affirmative action in the characters that I don’t think would play out the way it did in the book in real life, but understandably needed to be done to progress this particular story.\n\nHowever, my reason for not giving this a full 5 stars is that this final 15% felt as if it just lost steam and wasn’t sure of how it wanted to end, so it took a milder finale that had me feeling a little deflated, going from full speed ahead to a little bit of, “Wait, that’s it?” I believe the ending was designed to give the reader some authority over how they perceived not only the entire story, but also what happens after the final page is turned, although I would have been more satisfied with full closure.\n\nThat said, this game of cat and mouse was such a deviously delightful read that I can’t help but highly recommend it for your 2022 TBR. While not my favorite Lisa Jewell novel, it is an immensely enjoyable read that will be a fantastic book club choice, brimming with copious discussion material.\n\n*Many thanks to the publisher for my review copy.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "Lisa Jewell's latest Psychological Thriller grabbed my attention from the start and held it all the way through. This was absolutely addictive!!\n\nWhen I first heard about this, I could hardly believe it. A story that follows two women turning forty-five, and I am turning forty-five this year. It can't be coincidence...\n\n\n\n\nI just knew I was going to love it and per usual, I was right. Not only did I love it, I freaking loved it. This will definitely be on my Favorites of the Year list.\n\nAn added treat was Buddy Reading it with my beautiful niece, Lyss. I definitely recommend it for Buddy Reads or Book Clubs. There's a lot to discuss.\n\n\n\n\nThis story follows two women, Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, and Josie Fair, an unassuming woman, whose profession is so inconsequential, I can't recall it.\n\nAlix and Josie bump into each other for the first time in the bathroom of a local pub, coincidentally on the day they were both turning 45. They were birthday twins!\n\n\n\n\nShortly after, they bump into each other again outside of the school that Alix's children currently attend, and Josie's attended years ago.\n\nAs they are chatting, Josie, who has listened to Alix's podcast, pitches an idea to her. Alix should do a podcast focusing on Josie's life.\n\nJosie tells Alix that she is on the brink of making some very drastic changes and she'd like Alix to document the process.\n\n\n\n\nEven though Alix finds Josie's vibe unsettling, she admits there's something fascinating about her. She is intrigued.\n\nUnable to resist temptation to dig into Josie's life, Alix accepts her offer and begins to record the podcast, inviting Josie to her home studio for interview sessions.\n\n\n\n\nFrom that point on, the women's lives become entangled. It doesn't take long for Alix to suspect that Josie is so much more than she initially appeared. Josie is a smart woman, who happens to be hiding some very dark secrets.\n\nJosie infiltrates Alix's life so deeply, she eventually ends up living at her house. Alix hardly knows how any of this happened and then suddenly, Josie's gone. That's when Alix's real nightmare begins.\n\n\n\n\nI was completely swept up in the lives of these two women. I loved the back and forth, learning about their past and present circumstances. Their dynamic, as well, was fascinating.\n\nRight off the bat, I was intrigued and I felt like I was being misdirected in some way. The path the story took, I was never quite sure who I could trust.\n\nAs the story progresses, it's like a veil being pulled from your eyes, but I still couldn't believe what I was reading. It was so twisted!\n\n\n\n\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced and tense Psychological Thrillers. Bonus points if you have enjoyed Jewell's work in the past, or love stories that incorporate a podcast, or true crime, element.\n\nFor the record, I thought Jewell nailed the podcast turned True Crime documentary angle. Additionally, her use of mixed media, with the sections from the Netflix series, was amazingly well done; round of applause.\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much to the publisher, Atria Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review. This was an absolute blast to read. I cannot wait to pick up more from this author!\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "Outlier review! 🫣\n\nI was THRILLED to receive a VERY early copy of this book, not due out until December 10, 2024-but unfortunately I wasn’t quite as thrilled with the story.\n\nDr. Richmond Dougherty was not only a renowned pediatric surgeon, but also an infamous tragedy survivor, and a national hero.\n\nThat is-he WAS until an unfortunate fall down the stairs.\n\nAnd, it doesn’t look good that in the ninety-seven days since marrying the SECOND Mrs. Dougherty, Addison, that he’d had not one, but TWO other suspicious “accidents”.\n\nNow Addison is a VERY rich widow-but one who has been left wondering WHO tried to kill her husband TWICE before succeeding-because that was supposed to be HER job!!\n\nThis was an ORIGINAL premise that started out well, unfolding from the very SNARKY first person POV (including inner thoughts) of our main protagonist, Addison.\n\nI was “ALL IN” !\n\nThen at 50%, we were privy to a chapter from HIS POV-one of those LONG conversations where the bad guy confesses his sins so that we have an opportunity to see just how despicable he REALLY was.\n\nAND then things took a turn for the worse…\n\nAddison’s home became a CONSTANT revolving door of uninvited guests, and the entire second half felt like one conversation after another until “what the wife knew” was revealed.\n\nI began to lose interest.\n\nThings became pretty convoluted at this point and the ending made me CRINGE!\n\nReally? WHO would do that??\n\nI think my tastes may just be changing. I still love mystery/suspense but in the last few years, I feel like my love for the PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER may be waning.\n\nThis genre used to be FUN, but it seems to be getting TOO TWISTY and TOO OTT for me, as authors try to AMP UP the shock value.\n\nBe sure to read a sample of reviews to determine if this one might be a better fit for you!\n\nAVAILABLE NOW!\n\nThank You to William Morrow for the gifted ARC, provided through NetGalley. These are my candid thoughts.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Triple wow once again! This book really gave my brain cells a workout with its hurling twists and complex dysfunctional family relationships that I needed to fully absorb. I can honestly say that this has become my favorite Darby Kane novel to date! I've enjoyed her previous works as well, and interestingly, I've never been keen on reading psychological thrillers focused on unlikable and unreliable characters. However, this time, I can make an exception because this book is just too intelligent and deliciously intriguing, even though most of the characters cannot be considered decent human beings and are mostly despicable entities disguised in human furs, including the victim, Richmond Dougherty, whose innocence becomes hard to define as his past is revealed throughout the chapters. Before reading his point of view, we already get a picture of this narcissistic, cheating, manipulative man who would go to extreme lengths to secure a win.\n\nNow, let's delve into the main plot, which mostly revolves around Addison, only 27 years old and an unlucky widow of Dr. Richmond Dougherty, who passed away after only being married for 97 days, which felt like an eternity of entitlement. A survivor of a school shooting at a young age and hailed as a hero for saving his fellow student friends at the expense of stopping his own brother, Richmond was a shining star as a pediatric surgeon, with everyone singing his praises. When he leaves his longtime wife, Kathryn, to marry his younger wife, Addison, nobody blames him except the second wife, who may have been manipulated into a forged marriage. After his death under suspicious circumstances, questions arise within the community, loyal to Richmond and his first wife Kathryn, who has deep connections in society and the police squad. Kathryn plays the martyr card from the beginning, pointing fingers at the second wife as a person of interest.\n\nAddison knows two things for sure: she despises Richmond Dougherty, whom she was forced to marry as part of a revenge plan that turned into a dangerous cat-and-mouse game until the end, and she is not the person who killed him.\n\nShe is also certain of two more things: she must find the killer before the biased police officers, influenced by Kathryn's statements, throw her behind bars, and she must carry out her plan to tarnish Richmond Dougherty's reputation. But how can she accomplish this dangerous task when Richmond's enemies are closing in to take a piece of him, and someone is obviously targeting her to silence the secrets she knows? Everyone in town wants to see her fail, including Richmond's ex-wife and two elder kids. And another opponent decides to reveal herself, making things even more complicated, as this person is so close to her and may have already ruined her life, leaving Addison with compromised options and the feeling of being trapped in her own inherited mansion.\n\nOverall, this is a smart, riveting page-turner, filled with a web of lies, scheming, and twists that you never see coming. Every character in this book harbors big secrets and hidden agendas, and nobody can be trusted. While you may have questions about Addison's past as a con artist at the beginning, as you learn more about her tragic history, you understand her motivations, and she becomes the only character you may root for amidst the rest of them committing jaw-droppingly despicable acts that would make any decent human being cringe.\n\nI'm awarding this book 5 stars, even though the characters completely irritated me, because the pacing, cohesion, and conclusion of the book were executed perfectly. I truly enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and William Morrow for providing me with this addictive thriller's digital review copy in exchange for my honest opinions.\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\nmedium blog\ninstagram\nfacebook\ntwitter\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "OH. MY. GOD!!! There are simply no words for the utter perfection held within the pages of What the Wife Knew. From the morally gray characters to the twisty, twisty plot, I was spellbound from the epic first line until the breathtaking last page. I’m not joking. A fast-paced, revenge-filled storyline that was filled with plot charging drama, I couldn’t get enough of this mind-blowing psychological thriller. Trust me when I say that you’re going to have a hard time putting this one down no ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nAs much as I loved the whip-cracking plot, the characters were what made this book sing. A combination of thoroughly unlikeable characters and one strong, snarky protagonist at the center of the action, I became more and more invested as the plot rolled along. Addison, however, was firmly my favorite. Bringing to life dysfunctional family dynamics, it was her dynamite character arc that brought it all full circle by the downright explosive conclusion.\n\nReturning to the intoxicating premise, I was beyond thrilled to finally find a synopsis that—for once—didn’t even hint at the shocking twists and turns. With dual POVs and plenty of flashbacks, the puzzle pieces slowly slotted into place with a steady IV drip of jaw-dropping revelations. Packed full of devious schemes, long-buried secrets, and unthinkable lies, all I could do was hold on for dear life as Darby Kane pulled the wool firmly—and happily—over my eyes.\n\nAll in all, while I already knew that this book was sure to be a slam dunk due to the author, I had no clue it was going to turn into my favorite of Ms. Kane’s—so far. It’s also not surprising that all of my colleagues at Thriller Book Lovers: The Pulse have been clamoring over this one for weeks. Action-packed, thrilling, and smartly plotted, I highly advise you to clear your calendar before picking up this novel. After all, you’ll surely be ignoring chores, sleep, and maybe even your children just to read one more hypnotic page. Rating of 5+ stars.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nDr. Richmond Dougherty is a renowned pediatric surgeon, an infamous tragedy survivor, and a national hero. He’s also very dead—thanks to a fall down the stairs. His neighbors angrily point a finger at the newest Ms. Dougherty, Addison. The sudden marriage to the mysterious young woman only lasted ninety-seven days, and he’d had two suspicious “accidents” during that time. Now Addison is a very rich widow.\n\nAs law enforcement starts to circle in on Addison and people in town become increasingly hostile, sides are chosen with Kathryn, Richmond’s high school sweetheart, wife number one, and the mother of his children, leading the fray. Despite rising tensions, Addison is even more driven to forge ahead on the path she charted years ago…\n\nDetermined at all costs to unravel Richmond’s legacy, she soon becomes a target—with a shocking note left on her bedroom wall: You will pay. But it will take a lot more than faceless threats to stop Addison. Her plan to marry Richmond then ruin him may have been derailed by his unexpected death, but she’s not done with him yet.\n\nThank you to Darby Kane, William Morrow, and NetGalley for my complimentary physical and digital copies. All opinions are my own.\n\nPUB DATE: December 10, 2024\n\nScroll down for my potentially plot spoiling trigger list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger warning: blackmail, domestic violence, anaphylaxis, gun violence, mention of: school shooting, infidelity\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "War of the roses!🔪🌹\nDoes anyone come away unscathed?\n\nThe main characters:\nKathryn - The first wife and mother of Richmond’s two children. She may be the ex but she’s not about to let go and watch another woman waltz off with her extravagant life, I mean her husband.😉\n\nAddison - You guessed it, the new wife. She’s in the marriage for everything except love. You’ll find out her reasons soon enough.\n\nRichmond -The knight in shining armor. Pediatric surgeon. Pillar of the community. A man everyone looks up to. Everyone except his current wife. Now why would that be?\n\nI really enjoyed most of the book but the ending just didn’t work for me. I’m all about a shocking final twist. Always in search of that final jaw-dropping moment where you sit back and let out a whispered “wow”. But this ending just went a bit too OTT🙈.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and William Morrow\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Audio upped this to a 3.5 ⭐\n\nThe beginning was ..... off to the races! The audio was super fantastic. I was hooked for the first two thirds!\n\nI think all the drama went on a bit too long and then went completely off the rails! I still thought it was a fun, very twisty ride (maybe too twisted really). Let's say I was ready for the END.\n\nRead if you love twisty popcorn revenge plots and don't mind stretching your imagination to the edge. The characters are all hiding something and have their own agendas. Plenty of wifey and ex-wife revelations, lots of questionable acts and over the top kitchen sink ending! 🤷‍♀️\n\n\n\n\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "3.5 stars— One thing I can always say about Darby Kane’s books is that they are always original. However, unlike some authors ( Riley Sager and Grady Hendrix) she manages to be original but not go off of the deep end as far as the believability of the plot. This is why I enjoy her novels, even when the characters are not the type I usually cheer for. “What the Wife Knew” begins with Addison attending the funeral of her recently murdered husband, Richmond Dougherty. Addison lets us know from the beginning that she did not murder her husband, so who did? The author then lays out a very interesting narrative about the circumstances of Addison’s and Richmond’s marriage as well as introduces the hostile ex-wife and her two children into the mix. As the story unfolds I had to laugh because the entire premise of the book is so warped you will never guess the backstory despite the bits and pieces the author doles out throughout the book. Most of the book is written from Addison’s perspective and her persistent obnoxious sarcasm was right up my alley. However, the book suffers from the lack of any truly likable characters. When the entire plot is revealed it is difficult to root for any of the characters. With most (if not all) of the characters so flawed I never got to the “I love this book and can’t wait to see what happens next” status. It was more like “let’s see what is happening with this train wreck of a family today.” Was I glad I read this book? Yes. Will I ever list it as one of my favorites? Absolutely not. But, I will definitely read Darby Kane again due to her unpredictability and originality. I just hope I like the characters better next time.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "What a convoluted non event this turned out to be it was a mess! I am not going to say much about this book …but I will say I enjoyed this one up to about half way, the book was for me a book of two haves good in the first but dull in the second half, listed on audio & even the narrators got on my nerves didn’t like any of the characters.\n\nLet’s just say the reveals were too much & overdone I worked this out early on need I say more.\nShow more",

I binged it in a day and I am not sorry about it.\n\nAddison is wife number 2 for Richmond Dougherty, acclaimed paediatrician and famous for his actions back when he was a teenager. They have been married for a sort few months when Richmond is found dead. Obviously, Addison is prime suspect but what about all the others that held grudges against him? it is clear early on that theirs was not a happy marriage so what is going on with that??\n\nThere are some really nasty characters in this story, but I loved Addison. She was strong and snarky and didn’t take any crap from anyone. I would not want to be in her bad side.\n\nThanks so much to William Morrow on NetGalley for my advanced copy of this book to read.

        "Review 1": "This is a historical fiction debut novel by A. Rae Dunlap. If you enjoy twisty gothic tales set in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1828, then this may be the book for you. It pulls from true crime of the period with some real people, including criminals, being featured in this fictional story of a dark period in Scottish history.\n\nJames Willoughby, as the third son of a landed gentry family, is too physically inept to join the military and abandons his studies at Oxford to pursue a dream of studying surgery in Edinburgh. The city’s university offers everything he desires except the change to work on a human cadaver. To do this, he must join a private school in Surgeon’s Square. Without the necessary funds, he strikes a deal with Aneurin (Nye) MacKinnon for half tuition in return for helping him without realizing that Nye is a body-snatcher. With rival gangs and unsavory characters mixing with pioneering medical procedures and the pursuit of science plus a forbidden love for the time-period, there’s a combination of fact and fiction.\n\nJames tends to have physical ineptitude, wants a sense of belonging, yearns for a purpose, and is a loyal friend. He’s also a driven student, somewhat innocent, and an advocate for justice. The other characters are well-defined.\n\nBesides great characterization, the world-building was fantastic. From James’s room at the inn to the surgery center to scenes of gore and violence, it was easy to visualize. The blend of true crime and historical fiction had me researching this time-period to find out more about the true crime aspect of this story and the body-snatching business of the time. My biggest quibbles with the book were that I felt the writing style was somewhat formal and sometimes this resulted in more telling than showing. While many have classified this as a historical mystery, I didn’t get the feel that there was much of a mystery. It was more of a straight historical fiction novel to me. Other threads woven through the story include friendship, academic exploits, power, concepts of morality, class divisions, and treatment of women.\n\nOverall, this was an entertaining story that had great characterization and was very atmospheric. The author’s note and the discussion questions are worth reading and thinking about them.\n\nKensington Publishing and A. Rae Dunlap provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. The publication date is currently set for December 24, 2024.\n------------------------------------------\nMy 3.98 rounded to 4 stars review is coming soon.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "4.5 ☆\n\nWhat a stunning debut! The writing was incredibly immersive and so beautiful that I was immediately drawn in. I loved the way the author took the real life events surrounding the Burke and Hare killings and included their own fictional elements while still staying true to the goings on of the time.\n\nMaybe it’s my love of science and true crime that caused it, but I couldn’t help but support them excavating these bodies in the name of research. Aneurin, who is the assistant of the famous Dr. Malstrom, painted such an exquisite picture to make one not view these body snatchings as crimes, but as a way to revolutionize the medical field, the effects trickling down to other aspects of life.\n\nThe romance between James and Aneurin was so cute! It didn’t take away from the mystery at all; but was rather just another thing to love about the story! Aneurin, along with his band of body snatchers, greatly contributed to James’s character development and I loved seeing him come into himself.\n\nI’m finding historical fiction to be a genre I enjoy and I can’t wait for more people to read this! If you like gothic writing, macabre settings, hilariously dramatic characters with a little romance, then this is definitely the book for you. Dunlap definitely outdid herself and I’m excited to see what else she delivers in the future.\n\nThank you NetGalley and Kensington publishing for this arc in exchange for a review!\n\n⤷ Fave quotes/lines:\n\n• ’Yet I must insist that in the end, this is not a story about Death. It is perhaps a Life story, or even--yes--a Love story. It is the story of how I clawed my way from the decay of a crumbling legacy into the modern era of Reason and Science. It is the story of how I escaped the prison of archaic superstition to the freedom of enlightenment. It is the story of how a rose can blossom from even the bloodiest soil, of how light can grow from shadow, how love can grow from despair.’\n\n• Aneurin’s eyes raked across my face, and I had the uncomfortable sensation of being dissected without so much as a single incision. At long last, he responded. “I can’t tell whether you’re stupider than you seem, more naive than I’d come to believe, or so intentionally obtuse as to be a rare and volatile combination of the two.”\n\n• “You came to Edinburgh because you were looking for the face of God and couldn’t find it in your Bible. Don’t cast blame on me if His true appearance is not the one of beatific serenity you’d been deceived into believing. This is the face of Progress, James. Don’t you dare look away.”\n\n• ‘How could anything be unnatural when our coupling felt as easy as breathing air? How could the life I’d found with Nye be anything other than a benediction, full of grace? How could Nye ever be less than everything?’\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "I really hoped to love this book, and while I was able to enjoy it, it was a bit of a struggle. There are certainly things I enjoyed, so let’s focus on those, first. The whole concept is one I really appreciate; it is a fun piece of history to play with. By superimposing these two outsider identities, queerness and being a body snatcher, never mind the contrasts between the class and social status of the various characters, there is a great opportunity for commentary about how society works and what is expected of different individuals. I don’t think those opportunities are exploited as much as they could be, but the ideas are definitely floated about. Additionally, while there is a part of me that is frustrated by the nonchalance of the queer awakening in this story, I also appreciate it for that, as well. There is no self-torture or denial, there is never anything other than this feels right and so I am going to follow that instinct, and I appreciate that. I would have liked a little internal conversation, some sort of reckoning or acknowledgment, especially given how dangerous it was to be queer at that time, which is brought up later in the story, and that never really happens, which was disappointing. I don’t need hysterics and self-damnation, but it felt like we got little internal shift or recognition of something quite monumental. Still, I found myself appreciating how little drama this occupied in our character’s mind.\n\nThe characters were on the right path to me, but didn’t quite get there. They weren’t bland, but they did feel like they slipped into easy archetypes or expectations. Nothing they did really surprised me, I should say. I think if we had spent more time with his other friends, who we only get bits of here and there, we could have seen more sides of the characters and let them feel more lived-in and robust. Still, they didn’t bore me, and I think we did see a decent amount of character growth in James, even if the trajectory was expected.\n\nI think what really made the book hard for me, though, was the writing and plotting. Now, the writing and plotting weren’t bad, but they just didn’t work for me. Firstly, I really didn’t like that the narrator broke the fourth wall to address the reader, and more than once. This immediately created a sense of artifice that I think harmed my investment, because it didn’t add anything or change the stakes in any useful way. But in addition to that narrative framing, the writing felt too eager for me, maybe a little twee, and because of that slightly tortured. For instance, there were words italicized in what felt like every paragraph, and I am sure it wasn’t that many, but it certainly felt that way. Both dialogue and narration, there were just italics running around all over the place and it made everything feel a little forced. Additionally, there were some language choices and turns of phrase that felt belabored. A few of that, sprinkled throughout, adds style and tone and I really appreciate it. Here it was just too much, too often. I do get the point, the whole story is from the point of view of a character who has a very specific upbringing and history and education, and he thinks in these kinds of florid, too-smart-for-his-own-good kind of turns of phrase. I like it when the writing style does some of the character-building work, but they were overly frequent enough to distract me.\n\nI think part of my issue, to be fair, is that this story is far more YA than I had anticipated. The plot is very simple, and each obstacle comes up and then is mostly solved right away before moving on, with only minimal lingering effects. Even the deadly obstacle alluded to in the description is barely an important plot point, it is introduced very late in the story and solved readily. So, the plotting feels very much like it sets something up and then knocks it down, I didn’t feel anything lingering in any meaningful way throughout the whole book. Everything was tidy and convenient, which made it less interesting to me. The book actually borders on cozy, with very brief on-page violence near the end but otherwise nothing happens on the page in any titillating or violent ways, which just made everything feel really safe. For a story about a queer man—at a time when being queer could get you handed—who steals bodies from graves. I never really felt any danger in the story. The florid writing and sequential/episodic plotting combine with this to just feel far less complicated and messy and deeply intriguing than the premise and characters held the promise of being. Which, I think, is fine. Like I said, it feels like a YA, almost cozy exploration of a macabre topic. While the writing and plotting didn’t work for me, there was a clear style that might be exactly what others are looking for in this book. While I think everything could have been turned up a little—from character depth to more intricate plotting to introducing actual feelings of dread or danger, physical or emotional, that lasted more than a page before being resolved—and that would have made the book more appealing to me, there is a definite competency in the authorial voice and decisions.\n\nI want to thank the author, the publisher Kensington Publishing, and NetGalley, who provided a complimentary eARC for review.

        "Review 8": "A naive young medical student joins a group of body snatchers who supply cadavers to medical schools in Edinburg. They eventually run afoul of a competing group of snatchers, apparently based on a real life infamous duo.\n\nIf the blurb had warned me that this is a romance novel I probably would not have selected it. Because of the romance and the way that the two main characters are depicted, the book had a lightness to it that didn’t seem to fit the subject. The world asl seemed somewhat underpopulated. There are only 2 female characters, \nand they get to be victimized in different ways. The actual grave robbing descriptions were interesting (although gross), but that is only a small part of the book. Medical science was also a very small part of the book. This wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t what I expected.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "My heartfelt thanks to NetGalley and Kensington Publishing for the opportunity to read the ARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nJames seems fated to be the disappointment of his whole family (look how he's introduced! look! it's🤌: my father never had particularly high aspirations for me, so the fact that I was able to underwhelm him so completely was quite the accomplishment indeed). A younger son, he's expected to go into the military, but is uniquely ill-suited for that career. The family comes up with an alternative option: the clergy. James manages to thwart even those expectations:\n\n\nit quickly became clear to me that life in the Church could never suffice. As ill-suited as I was to be a leader, it was evident that I was a considerably worse follower, and uniquely repelled by both mundanity and tradition. Classics bored me, rhetoric confounded me, and the few Theology lectures I attended failed to ignite wonder.\n\n\nHe does have an intellectual passion though: medicine. Edinburgh is the place to be in the 1830s if you are really serious about having a front-row seat for the advancement of medical science and for learning through hands-on experience rather than rote memorization of outdated texts. So off to Edinburgh James scarpers, whereupon he discovers ever new and exciting ways to disappoint his family: digging up graves to procure specimen for the study of anatomy! disregarding the marriage plot that his family concocts for him! entering a relationship with his employer (who's both male and lower-class and Scottish--I'm not sure which point is more scandalous here)!\n\nIf you are into the history of body-snatching, chances are you will enjoy this. (This sordid episode in the history of science was my niche interest for about 15 minutes--to the point where I could see one plot twist in this novel coming because I remembered the victim's name--so I greatly enjoyed the grisly logistics of this trade, etc.) If you don't have residual fondness for the Burke and Hare debacle and don't enjoy verbose faux-archaic prose (which I love with a passion, but still found certain passages overwritten), then this might be not for you. It's somewhat hard to tell what the book's load-bearing structure was supposed to be, plot-wise. Is it a history novel about the murky borderlands between two eras and two regimes of knowledge, the weird combination of enlightenment and gothic horror? It seems to posit so: It is the story of how I clawed my way from the decay of a crumbling legacy into the modern era of Reason and Science. It is the story of how I escaped the prison of archaic superstition to the freedom of enlightenment. But ultimately, that doesn't seem to be the focus. Is it a Bildungsroman? While some of the trappings of the genre are there, James doesn't have any dilemmas and doubts and character growth. Is it a romance? The romantic subplot doesn't start until ~50% in, with little setup prior to that. Is it a murder mystery? Burke and Hare don't show up until ~70% in, and the investigation, such as it was, felt very rushed and perfunctory. I still enjoyed it because I have a morbid fascination with this story, but the pacing and structure did feel a bit odd.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "I picked this book knowing only that it involved Edinburgh (a favourite place of mine) and Burke & Hare. That was enough to get me interested, but the story kept me hooked. The characters herein are so well put together, coupled with the way the author seamlessly adds world building, supplies a story that makes for an exciting novel. Having never read a book with two MMC who are in a relationship before, I have no basis to state wether this aspect was dealt with appropriately, but I feel it was handled with care and consideration, leaving a description of an evolving relationship. I really enjoyed this book."

        "Review 1": "WOWZA!\n\nGripping, tense, dark, horrific and hard to put down! Like two of the main characters, I was instantly grabbed from the very beginning of What the Woods Took! This book had me turning the pages, not wanting to put it down as I was fully invested in what was going to happen next in this coming-of-age tale of survival!\n\nDevin Green, asleep at her foster home, is taken from her bed in the middle of the night and thrown in a van. In the van she meets Oliver, a teen who was also grabbed at his home as he slept as well. Initially, they are given very little information, which ramps up their anxiety and unease. What they do know is that they are being taken to an experimental therapy program where they will hike, camp, and survive in the woods with two camp counselors and other teens for 50 days. The intended result of the therapy program is that the teens will emerge from the woods changed for the better! When they wake up and their two camp counselors are missing, the teens find themselves faced with the unimaginable!\n\nI enjoyed the mixing of personalities and backgrounds of the teens in this book. I also enjoyed their dynamics with each other and their reactions after being thrust into a situation beyond their control. Can you imagine strangers waking you up and taking you by force with little to no explanation. That you are a minor and have no say in what is happening to you? I thought Courtney Gould did a fantastic job of depicting this. I enjoyed how Devin fought and tried to escape while Olive, who did not like the situation, was more accepting of what was happening. Their reactions alone in the beginning of the book show their personalities. Then they meet the other teens who are distinct and add so much to the plot.\n\nWhat the Woods Took has that trapped feeling that I enjoy in books. While they are not physically locked into any room or house, the group of teens do have the task of finding their way out of the woods - woods that they are unfamiliar with. Survival is the name of the game for them. This book was oozing with atmosphere. I also enjoyed the sense of unease, tension and mounting danger. I enjoyed the sense of something-isn't-quite-right that morphed into full on fear! When they learned that they were not alone in the woods, the creepy factor went off the charts. Their therapy adventure in the woods morphed into a horrific nightmare! What the Woods Took also morphed into a great story about friendship, romance, survival, trust, and battling your own demons.\n\nCreepy, scary, tense, well thought out, spooky!\n\nI had both the book and the audiobook versions of this book which made for an enjoyable reading experience. I found the narration of the audiobook to be wonderful.\n\nThank you to Wednesday Books, Macmillan Audio, and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

        "Review 3": "Hey Siri- Please play Teenagers by My Chemical Romance\n\n3.85 Stars\n\nWhat the Woods Took is a powerful narrative about survival, friendship, and confronting personal trauma. Gould handles sensitive topics with a remarkable amount of care and nuance, and it’s evident that a great deal of research went into crafting this story. The way the author explores the psychological and emotional layers of the characters’ experiences, especially in the face of trauma, is both thoughtful and poignant.\n\nThe author's writing is masterful, creating an intensely atmospheric experience that pulls the reader deep into the heart of the forest. As a group of teens ventures further into the woods, the tension is palpable—I could almost feel the dense, claustrophobic forest closing in around them, amplifying the sense of danger and uncertainty. Every twist and turn in the narrative kept me on the edge of my seat, with suspense hanging over every page, as I never quite knew what to expect next.\n\nThe character development is truly exceptional. As the layers of each camper’s backstory and inner struggles are gradually revealed, I found myself deeply invested in their individual journeys. Each character felt fully realized and complex, and I couldn't help but root for them as they navigated the harrowing challenges they faced. Devin and Sheridan were especially compelling, their personalities jumping off the page with raw emotion and authenticity. But what truly impressed me was the growth of Ollie—this character's arc was a standout for me. Watching Ollie evolve over the course of the story added an emotional depth that made the experience even more impactful.\n\nThis is a story of survival and monsters, but at its heart, it’s a poignant tale of found family—one that reminds us that the most unexpected bonds can be forged in the most unlikely of place.\n\n✨Thanks to NetGalley, The Author, & St. Martins Press for an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review✨\nShow more",

        "Review 7": "The Sisters are at it again, rambling and swapping thoughts on What the Woods Took by Courtney Gould. Equal parts chilling and heart-wrenching, leaving us captivated by what the woods took from its characters—and, perhaps more importantly, what it gave back to them.\n\nMy Take:A Dark and Twisty YA Thriller Full of Drama, Terror, and Transformation\n\nThere is something about creepy things happening in the woods that gives me those perfect eerie, spooky vibes. And this book? It delivers all that and more with a side of teenage drama and raw emotional chaos. \n\nSo, we’ve got a group of teenagers dropped into a wilderness therapy program, and let’s just say things go way off the rails. Suddenly, they’re left to fend for themselves in the woods, where some truly terrifying and unsettling things start happening. The atmosphere in this book is spot on as Gould builds tension, crafting a forest that feels alive—teeming with unknown monsters, both lurking in the shadows and the ones buried deep within us. It’s a place where their darkest fears and trauma collide with real threats, and every shadow feels far too real to ignore. \n\nThere is so much heart to the story, packed into all that terror. Beneath the monsters and the survival story, there is plenty of depth to delve into. It’s about trauma and transformation, about those bonds that form when people are thrown into life-or-death situations. When they need protection from the outside world and themselves. \n\nNow, I’ll admit, I’m not the biggest fan of teenagers and their endless drama—but their pain, their struggles, and raw emotions. That stuff gets me every time. I can’t help but have a soft spot for them, and Gould nails that vulnerability perfectly in this story. \n\nTalking about that drama there is plenty of it when exploring the dynamics between the characters and it does get to be a bit much at times. It is a YA so it’s to be expected. Gould does weave in enemies-to-lovers tropes that feels fresh and different with those horror elements.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the themes! Gould layers trauma, survival, and self-discovery beautifully. These kids are broken in different ways, but there’s a powerful message here about how connection and love can help us piece ourselves back together, even when the world (or the woods) is out to get us.\n\nThe Sister’s Final Thoughts\nIf you’re looking for a YA novel that blends eerie supernatural elements with raw emotional depth, What the Woods Took is a must-read. We both agree: Gould has crafted a story that’s as chilling as it is heartfelt, packed with tension, trauma, and the transformative power of connection. Just be ready for a little teenage drama along the way.\n\nCheck out Norma's Take:Eerie, slow-burning, and transformative!\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "The Sisters are at it again, rambling and swapping thoughts on What the Woods Took by Courtney Gould. Equal parts chilling and heart-wrenching, leaving us captivated by what the woods took from its characters—and, perhaps more importantly, what it gave back to them.\n\n3.5 ⭐️ My take: Eerie, slow-burning, and transformative!\n\nWhat the Woods Took felt like stepping into a foggy forest where every hidden path led deeper into mystery. The premise instantly grabbed me—troubled teens sent into the wilderness for therapy, each carrying their own burdens, only to confront something far darker than they imagined.\n\nThe group dynamics were fascinating—alliances constantly shifting, secrets coming to light, and tension rising with each passing moment. Devin Green was a standout character for me—raw, resilient, and impossible not to root for.\n\nThe woods themselves held a presence that felt far more than just a setting—they were a constant, unsettling force throughout the story, drawing the characters deeper into their fears. The supernatural elements were chilling, perfectly mirroring the trauma the teens were experiencing. The atmosphere was so thick and vivid, I couldn’t shake it even when I wasn’t reading.\n\nWhat stayed with me most, though, was how the story explored survival and transformation. The teens had to face the darkest parts of themselves in order to survive—not just physically, but emotionally. The found family dynamic was also a powerful addition, showing how love and connection can give us the strength to fight through the darkest times.\n\nThe ending was heartfelt and touching, tying everything together beautifully with the story’s themes of survival, transformation, and the importance of connection. It left me reflecting long after the last page. That said, there were parts of the story where I felt a bit disconnected—perhaps due to pacing or a lack of deeper attachment to certain YA drama from the characters. Even so, the haunting atmosphere and thought-provoking themes stayed with me, making it a story that lingered long after I finished.\n\nIf you enjoy slow-burn supernatural tales that are as chilling as they are emotional, What the Woods Took is definitely worth exploring.\n\nBrenda’s Take: A Dark and Twisty YA Thriller Full of Drama, Terror, and Transformation\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\n\nThe Sister’s Final Thoughts\nIf you’re looking for a YA novel that blends eerie supernatural elements with raw emotional depth, What the Woods Took is a must-read.

        "Review 9": "somehow this is the second book i've read so far this year that features a gay makeout in a cold lake/stream deep in the forest? hopefully that bodes well for the year ahead...\n\noddly, this feels more YA than either of gould's prior novels. and compared to a typical YA horror/thriller, it's absolutely stellar, but compared to gould's other works, it's not the greatest. nevertheless, it has all of the excellent hallmarks of her writing - gritty emotions, parental trauma, sinister and mysterious landscape, supernatural terror, and a messy fledgling gay romance.\n\nthis is a story of troubled teens forced to embark on a multiweek hike as part of \"wilderness therapy.\" the first act feels foremost like a survival story, which is marred by how unrealistic and vague the survival elements are. there's no detail about the logistics of the backpacking trek, and there's a total lack of concern about wildlife or obtaining resources, let alone the endurance of a group of so many young and inexperienced hikers. i get that this part of the story is setting the scene for when things kick into gear, but the unrealistic elements were very distracting.\n\nbut then, the creatures emerge, things get scary and surreal and brutally life-or-death, and this is where the book shines. the mimics seriously creeped me out! and monsters that imitate people from your real life, and use words to break you down until you surrender to death - what a terrifying way to explore past traumas. since the mimics can transform into anyone, there's also a super juicy \"impostor among us\" element.\n\ngould is a master at maintaining tension over the course of a novel, and once it kicks in, it doesn't let up. i love the landscape and the creeping darkness of the forest. i also love the way that the monsters make trust an impossibility, yet this is a story about learning to rely on your allies, to have faith that you're going to save each other again and again.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "It’s the middle of the night, and Devin Green is fast asleep when it happens - she wakes up to two strange men in her room, abducting her. When she screams for her foster parents, they just watch her leave, telling her this is for the best. She’s being sent to the REVIVE Teen Rehabilitation Journey after fighting in school, and she’ll spend the next 50 days hiking through the wilderness in the hopes of, well, rehabilitation.\n\nShe arrives at a forest in Idaho with Ollie, another teenager abducted from his home. They soon meet Aidan, Hannah and Sheridan, along with their psycho counselors, Coach Ethan and Coach Liv. These young strangers have no choice but to play along; there is nowhere to escape to and nowhere to hide. They begin their hike and start to form tentative friendships, definite rivalries, and a disdain for sleeping outdoors and talking about their feelings. Then one morning, they wake up to find the coaches gone. What do they do now?\n\nThat’s when we switch from a young adult book into more of a horror novel. Yes, this book is YA, something I don’t usually read, but this sounded good so I took a chance, and thankfully it wasn’t too immature. These teenagers aren’t alone in the woods, they are surrounding by monsters…and not just the ones they are escaping in their minds. The end of this started to drag a bit, and I’m normally not into monster horror because it can be cheesy, but at least this was slightly different. Overall, I enjoyed this creepy and atmospheric tale! 3.5 stars, rounded up.\n\n(Thank you to Wednesday Books, Courtney Gould and NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for my review. This book is slated to be released on December 10, 2024.)\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "I guess...one of the things I’ve realized is that people are...well, like houses, almost. We need foundations. We need...a solid platform, on top of which we can build.\n\nDavid is a bestselling author at twenty-eight. But instead of writing another fabulous book, his career is down the drain, his relationship with his dad is more or less nonexistent, and his boyfriend Jeremy is now his ex. He’s a guy who had everything but now has nothing, and loneliness, anxiety, and maybe even self-pity are luring around the corner. But then David meets Robert and finally thinks things are going to work out fine. Until he finds Robert dead in his bed.\n\nThis story hit close to home and crawled under my skin. Slowly. I didn’t feel it at first, until halfway through the book, my whole body started to itch.\n\nI was home alone for the first time in years and thought I’d love it, but I felt lonely instead and read:\nI had the strangest realization: my word count had gone way down.\n\nI was writing and petrified to share with others what I had written and read:\nThere’s something about the thought of other people reading my words that terrifies me.\n\nI can have these intrusive thoughts that I’m not good enough and read:\nI’d try to be less afraid. Less hard on myself. Happier.\n\nThis story is about foundations. The foundations you need to function in life. Passions. Desires. Family. Friends. David’s only foundation is his writing. And losing it would mean he no longer has meaning in life. It’s about doubt and insecurities. About believing in yourself. About letting other people in and letting them be your foundation. About being okay and sometimes not. And that it’s okay to be not okay sometimes.\n\nIn my last review, I asked myself why so many YA authors want to write adult books. To be honest, I’m not always a fan. But Daniel’s first adult novel struck a cord. It’s so different from all the others and cannot be grasped in one genre. I Might Be in Trouble is literary, contemporary, dark at times, and at the same time humorous, even ridiculous in a few moments. But above all, it’s deeply human and personal.\n\nDaniel, you touched my whole being with your story! Thank you so much for writing it. You definitely didn’t disappoint!\n\nThank you, Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley, for an ARC of one of my favorite authors!\n\nFollow me on Instagram\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "In a Nutshell: A dark, almost satirical comedy about a writer who finds himself “in trouble”, a clue of which is present in the cover art. Humorous, serious, bizarre, suspenseful, entertaining! Though this wasn’t exactly my cup of tea, and some of the content was way too forward for me, I still liked this ride. Recommended, but not to all. Works better if you go in prepared for a whole load of absurdities and with your logic kept aside.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPlot Preview:\n\nUntil a couple of years ago, David Alvarez was a success in every way. He had an acclaimed debut novel, a loving partner in Jeremy, and a fabulous book deal for his next writing attempt. But times do change, and now, Alvarez is all alone, with a poorly-received second book, no feasible plot idea for his third manuscript, and on the verge of financial bankruptcy. Stressed out, he often uses an online dating app to relieve his mental and sexual tension.\nAfter one such helluva night with a hot stranger, who could potentially be the next love of his life, David wakes up with a huge hangover, no memory of the previous night, and his date dead next to him in bed. He has no idea what happened, and worse, if he himself might have killed his date somehow. Horrified, David calls up the only person who has always rooted for him: his literary agent Stacey. Can Stacey help David sort out the mess, and maybe even figure out a potential story idea along the way?\nThe story comes to us in David’s first-person perspective.\n\n\n\nJust as any satirical dark comedy, this gets quite absurd and unbelievable. But I went in promising myself not to overanalyse any situation nor to evaluate the morality and ethics of the actions. Thus, I yeeted all disbelief while reading and just relaxed through this wild ride. This worked well for both the book and me.\n\n\nBookish Yays:\n📕 The dark comedy elements: wacky yet hilarious.\n\n📕 Stacey – deserves a separate yay. What a woman! Loved the connection between David and her.\n\n📕 The characters other than David and Stacey: Mostly cookie-cutter, but they are exactly what the book required.\n\n📕 The depiction of the uncertainties of author life, including the struggles of a writing block. Very well handled.\n\n📕 The use of the location and the people: I’m not sure if the depiction of New York was geographically accurate, but it felt believable – a crowded metropolis where people are so busy that they don’t even notice a dead body among them!\n\n📕 The tempo is somewhat fluid, going high and low as per the need of the story. But even when slow, it never slackens. I enjoyed the dynamic pacing.\n\n📕 Though comic in a horrifying kind of way, the story also offers some food for thought. Most important lesson – lies always beget more lies.\n\n📕 The cover – perfect for the book.\n\n\nBookish Mixed Bags:\n🖋️ The prologue – A great start to the book, but also details David’s quandary about waking up with a dead body in the room. This doesn’t occur until many chapters ahead, but as both the blurb and the prologue reveal that David’s date ends up dead, it takes away some of the suspense.\n\n🖋️ David. A master of getting himself into trouble by taking one self-centred and self-destructive decision after another, he also tends to be a bit self-pitying. As such, though twenty-eight, David sounds YA-ish in tone, especially as he loves to play the poor-ol’-me victim card often. But hey, likeable characters have no place in dark comedy, and if you keep this in mind, David suits the bill quite well.\n\n🖋️ The ending. It is good but somehow, it isn’t satisfying. I felt like it brushes away a lot of the responsibility of some characters’ misdeeds. But as the story is from David’s first-person perspective and it is supposed to be somewhat ironic, the choice of ending does make some sense.\n\n\nBookish Nays:\n☠️ The main reason for the dip in my rating is this feedback point: I found it ridiculous that the first thing David did on seeing the dead body was to call up his agent. Moreover, even when she turned up, her decision was not what a typical character would do. I know this is what made the book a comedy but even comedies have to be partially convincing. This scene felt more preposterous than farcical.\n\n☠️ The handling of Jeremy’s arc, especially at the end – a tad too forced. I wish there had been more punch to this relationship. Even a literal punch would have been welcome than this bland depiction.\n\n☠️ Personal preference: The adult content was way too high for my comfort level. Granted, the book deals with darker situations, but did we really need the extended anatomical descriptions?\n\n\nAll in all, the story is certainly unusual but its handling is even more so. It can be a fun ride if you read it sheerly for entertainment than for moral analyses.\n\nRecommended to those looking for an atypical adult comedy. Not for those who want their characters to get their just desserts, and not for those who want their lead characters to be sensible or likeable.\n\n3.75 stars.\n\n\nMy thanks to Grand Central Publishing for providing the DRC of “I Might Be in Trouble” via NetGalley.

        "Review 3": "When I originally picked up I Might Be in Trouble, I didn’t know quite what to expect. After all, the synopsis was gripping and I couldn’t wait for a book slightly different from my normal go-to genres, but, other than that, I went in mostly blind. As soon as I read that first thrilling chapter, however, I knew I was in for quite the ride. What I didn’t expect, though, was that on top of the dark humor, witty insights, and dynamite characterizations, I fell in love with not only David, but Daniel Aleman as well. Addictive, compulsively bingeable, and ultimately a quick, easy read, I raced through the book despite the somewhat slow burn beginning.\n\nThe two home run pieces to this captivating drama/mystery novel were easily David’s impressive character arc and the thought-provoking critique of self-worth, love, and what it means to succeed. Much deeper than I was anticipating, the laugh-out-loud moments definitely gave it some levity, but didn’t get in the way of David’s realistic journey throughout this thoroughly over-the-top novel. Don’t take that last bit wrong, however. I mean, I definitely needed to suspend all disbelief, but the entire plot somehow still felt both authentic and wholly relatable in spite of it all.\n\nAll said and done, from the built-in dysfunctional family dynamic to the satirical take on the publishing world, there wasn’t much missing from this ultimate home run. I especially loved the original narrative voice, which had me feeling as though David—or Daniel—was talking directly to me through his skillfully poignant dialogue and prose. And while it was somewhat less suspenseful than I had expected, the riveting climax and mildly open-ended conclusion filled out a plot that hit all the right chords. So if any of this sounds even remotely like your cup of tea, I highly recommend grabbing a copy ASAP. After all, David—and Daniel—provided one heck of a ride. Rating of 4.5 stars.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nA few years ago, David Alvarez had it all: a six-figure book deal, a loving boyfriend, and an exciting writing career. His debut novel was a resounding success, which made the publication of his second book—a total flop—all the more devastating. Now, David is single, lonely, and desperately trying to come up with the next great idea for his third manuscript, one that will redeem him in the eyes of readers, reviewers, the entire publishing world…and maybe even his ex-boyfriend.\n\nBut good ideas are hard to come by, and the mounting pressure of a near-empty bank account isn’t helping. When David connects with a sexy stranger on a dating app, he figures a wild night out in New York City may be just what he needs to find inspiration. Lucky for him, his date turns out to be handsome, confident, and wealthy, not to mention the perfect distraction from yet another evening staring at a blank screen.\n\nAfter one of the best nights of his life, David wakes up hungover but giddy—only to find prince charming dead next to him in bed. Horrified, completely confused, and suddenly faced with the implausible-but-somehow-plausible idea that he may have actually killed his date, David calls the only person he can trust in a moment of crisis: his literary agent, Stacey.\n\nTogether, David and Stacey must untangle the events of the previous night, cover their tracks, and spin the entire misadventure into David’s career-defining novel—if only they can figure out what to do with the body first.\n\nThank you to Daniel Aleman and Grand Central Publishing for my complimentary copy.

        "Review 4": "I am going to shout about this book to the rooftops! It contains so many different themes, all surrounding protagonist David Alvarez and the fierce loneliness that encompasses his life. There's also lost love, fairy-tale romance, the meaning of friendship, and grief--not to mention all-out panic. David becomes a literary wunderkind when his first book reaches the bestseller lists. But his second book tanks, and his agent, Stacey, is on his heels for another one. Trying to drown his sorrows, David swipes on Grindr until he finds Robert, a guy looking for a fun time. They spend a whirlwind night together and end up in David's apartment... where in the morning, Robert is dead. With no idea what to do, David calls Stacey, and the two of them begin a Weekend at Bernie's farce as they figure out how to dispense with Robert's body. The story seems to wrap at the midpoint, but a different season of David's life begins after that, and the reader is unsure of where things are headed. David himself is so complex, and I really identified with him and his struggles (despite never having a dead body in my bed... so far).\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "I would first like to thank net galley and Hachette book group for giving me the opportunity to read this book. When we first meet David he has just woken up to a dead body next to him in bed. The book follows how far he will go to jump start his flailing writing career by spinning this event.\nI hope you have tissues handy because this book handles everything. Aleman was able to write about insecurity, anxiety, loneliness, sadness, want, and joy so brilliantly that I wish I could go back and read this all over again for the first time. Not only did I audibly laugh out loud with some of the scenes and the narration but I was crying in the next chapter at how beautiful the moments were playing out. You can not put one genre to this book because it has everything. David is not happy with his current life, his first book a success, his second flopped. His ex has a new boyfriend and he has no money in his account. Trying to take his mind off of things he goes on a date, the only problem is he wakes up to his date dead. After wondering what to do, he spirals. He realizes so many things at once that finally when his life calms down a bit he manages to write his feelings down, which is what he always did when he had a low point. Through the book we follow the highs and lows of David's life with his Ex, his father and his new wife and his agent. This book is a journey of self discover, self acceptance, love, and mystery thrown in. If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would I loved it that much.\nShow more",

Instead what I got was a darkly funny, and emotional story about love, loss, family, growth, and so much more.

I devoured this story and enjoyed every page. The humor is balanced with heart and I enjoyed the main character’s journey toward finding the love and connection he deserved.

        "Review 9": "This dark comedy is a meta-exploration about the relationship success and loneliness that is a quick, fun romp that still leaves you with something to think about. The main character is a desperate mess of emotions and feels genuine and relatable. The secondary characters, be it the MC’s dates or his agent, all feel a little bit like caricatures, yet this actually works for the story. They are all foils for different aspects of the MC’s neuroses to play off of, and so they embody their particular roles with a type of glee that still makes fun and interesting. The world-building is done really well, giving us the claustrophobic experience of success at a young age that doesn’t always feel entirely earned, coupled with a family that isn’t supportive and an inner life that feels like a constant performance instead of an actual identity. So much of this story is about pretense, and the anxieties that come from not showing others who you are, either because you are afraid of how they will react or because you don’t know yourself or a combination of the two, and the world-building and tone embodies that sentiment well. The writing is strong throughout, with convincing dialogue and a compelling style that pulls you through, not overly saccharine or emotional but still really letting the reader feel connected to the main character’s despair. The pacing was great for me until the third act, which dragged a little. On one hand the characters themselves are in a type of limbo, a holding pattern, and that unknowing, which can feel interminable, is reflected in the writing, so the resonance between pacing and character experience works… but it feels like the whole third act simply happens to the character and he has given up any pretense at agency, which feels like being dragged along. I like the twists and turns and the places the story eventually ended up, but there is a little disconnect, for me, between where the emotional journey ultimately lands and the character’s seeming stagnation in the third act. Everything is believable, and as I said I do really appreciate where it ended up, but it I would have liked to see a more active role in that outcome. Especially as, during that third act, there are some potentially self-sabotaging behaviors that suggested the character may have bene traveling in emotional loops, and the way he emerged from that spiral felt a little sudden.\n\nOverall, this was a lot of fun. The mystery and story were a little predictable but never felt bland. The inner journey felt rich and relatable, overall, and offered an engaging exploration of loneliness and what it means to discover who you are and what you depend on when everything else is in chaos.\n\n(Rounded up from 3.5)\n\nI want to thank the author, the publisher Grand Central Publishing, and NetGalley, who provided a complimentary eARC for review.

        "Review 2": "Special thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a free, electronic ARC of this novel received in exchange for an honest review.\n\nExpected publication date: Dec. 3, 2024\n\n“Trouble Island” by Sharon Short, who also writes books under the pseudonym Jess Montgomery, is a historical suspense novel that takes place during the winer of 1932, on an isolated island off the coast of Lake Erie, that is based on actual events experienced by the author’s family.\n\nAurelia Escalante is the maid hired to serve Rosita McGee on Trouble Island. Rosita owns the only home on the island, along with her troubled ex-husband, Eddie, who Rosita wants nothing more than to divorce. Although Aurelia is grateful to Rosita for taking her on, Aurelia hides her own secrets and knows that even if she is able to escape Trouble Island, her past will follow her. When Eddie and his entourage arrive on the island with the intent of convincing Rosita to sell, Aurelia is convinced that Trouble Island will more than earn its name and all she can hope for is to come out on the other side- alive.\n\nTrouble Island is the perfect setting for a locked-in mystery such as this- an isolated manor house, secluded in every way and, once the winter ice sets in, there is no way off the island until the spring thaw. Set during the 1930s when Prohibition is still rampant in many of the United States, years before the Great Depression hits, is the high time for gangster Eddie and his team of cronies to “influence” “Eddie’s dame” Rosita, to give up her home.\n\nNarrated by Aurelia, right away it is obvious that she is hiding some big secret. She drops hints left and right but it isn’t until the final few sections when we finally found out why Aurelia was sent to the island, and her past relationship with Rosita. The other characters are just as interesting, and their backstories helped add extra drama to the already intriguing plot.\n\nMost locked-in mysteries have a few outcomes from which they can choose and, although I won’t give anything away, the biggest “Trouble Island” twist was a familiar trope. Short managed to ensure all of the characters got a satisfying ending, and there were definitely some unexpected points, but the ending was not completely original (although still very entertaining!).\n\nShort is known for her series of novels, and “Trouble Island” is her debut standalone. As much as I appreciate a good mystery series, I will give credit where it is due and applaud Short for taking the chance on this individual mystery. I will investigate Short’s past works at my leisure and I have no doubt I will not be disappointed.\nShow more",

TROUBLE ISLAND is irresistible.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "In Trouble Island, Sharon Short combines elements of historical fiction and suspense to craft a rich, atmospheric narrative set in the icy grip of 1932. Inspired by a real island in Lake Erie and interwoven with threads of her own family history, this novel invites readers into a world of gangsters, secrets, and murder. At the heart of the story are two women bound by loyalty and desperation, navigating treacherous waters—both literal and figurative.\n\nAs Short's first standalone suspense novel, Trouble Island earns its four-star rating with its evocative prose, intricate plot, and layered characters. However, it also leaves room for critique, particularly in its pacing and the resolution of certain subplots. This review delves into the book’s strengths and areas for improvement.\n\nSetting the Scene: A Masterful Atmosphere\n\nOne of Trouble Island’s greatest triumphs is its setting. The remote, snow-laden island in the middle of Lake Erie becomes a character in itself—menacing, isolating, and inescapable. Short’s prose captures the stark beauty of the landscape, from the forbidding limestone cliffs to the frigid waters teeming with danger.\n\nThe mansion, a crumbling symbol of gangster wealth and excess, mirrors the story’s themes of decay and entrapment. Short's description of the labyrinthine interiors—its libraries, ballrooms, and hidden nooks—draws readers into a world as lush as it is suffocating. Her attention to detail, down to the frost etching patterns on the windows, enhances the immersive experience.\n\nStrengths:\n\n- Vivid imagery that evokes both beauty and dread.\n- A strong sense of place that reflects the story’s themes.\n- The integration of historical elements, like Prohibition and its consequences, grounds the story in a specific era.\n\nCritique: While the atmosphere is compelling, it occasionally overshadows the pacing. The extended descriptions of the island and mansion, while rich, slow the momentum during key suspenseful moments.\n\nPlot: A Gripping Locked-Room Mystery with Layers of Deceit\n\nAt its core, Trouble Island is a locked-room mystery wrapped in layers of historical intrigue. The arrival of a motley crew of gangsters, a fading Hollywood star, and a rival criminal sets the stage for Rosita McGee’s sudden disappearance and subsequent murder. As the storm traps everyone on the island, tensions rise, and secrets bubble to the surface.\n\nAurelia Escalante, masquerading as a maid but hiding a dark past, emerges as the reluctant detective. Her struggle to untangle the web of lies while grappling with her own guilt creates a compelling dual narrative of internal and external conflict.\n\nStrengths:\n\n- The intricate web of relationships keeps readers guessing.\n- The novel balances personal stakes with broader societal themes, like gender roles and the long shadow of crime.\n- Twists and reveals are well-timed, particularly the shocking revelations about Rosita’s motives and Eddie McGee’s power plays.\n\nCritique:\n\n- Certain plot threads, like the rivalry between Eddie and Marco Guiffre, feel underdeveloped. Marco’s role, pivotal as it is, could benefit from more exploration.\n- The pacing occasionally falters in the middle sections, where tension gives way to prolonged introspection.\n\nCharacter Analysis: Complex Women at the Heart of Chaos\n\nAurelia Escalante and Rosita McGee anchor the story with their complexity. Both women are shaped by trauma and bound by secrets, yet their diverging goals drive the narrative tension.\n\nAurelia Escalante\n\nAurelia’s transformation from a fugitive burdened by guilt to a resourceful survivor is the novel’s emotional backbone. Short deftly explores Aurelia’s internal conflict—her desire for redemption clashes with her instinct for self-preservation. Her secret past as a gangster’s wife lends a noir-esque edge to her character.\n\nPraise:\n\n- Aurelia’s voice is distinct, reflective, and relatable.\n- Her interactions with other characters, particularly Rosita and Seamus, are charged with subtext and emotion.\n\nCritique: At times, Aurelia’s introspection feels repetitive, slowing the narrative. A tighter focus on her detective role could heighten the suspense.\n\nRosita McGee\n\nRosita is both victim and enigma. Her grief for her son and her fraught marriage to Eddie McGee make her a tragic figure, while her manipulative tendencies add layers to her character. Her dynamic with Aurelia—part friendship, part power struggle—injects the story with emotional complexity.\n\nCritique: Rosita’s motivations remain murky in places. Greater insight into her psychological state would enhance her impact as a pivotal character.\n\nThemes: Redemption, Loyalty, and the Weight of Secrets\n\nShort weaves themes of redemption, loyalty, and identity throughout the novel. Aurelia’s journey reflects the human desire to break free from the past, while Rosita’s arc underscores the destructive nature of unresolved grief. The narrative also critiques the patriarchal structures that trap both women, forcing them to navigate a world defined by male violence and control.\n\nThe island itself serves as a metaphor for entrapment, with its isolation mirroring the characters’ emotional and moral imprisonment.\n\nWriting Style: Lyrical Yet Grounded\n\nSharon Short’s prose is lyrical without losing the grit essential to a suspense novel. Her ability to shift between poetic descriptions and sharp, dialogue-driven scenes demonstrates her versatility.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- The opening sequence, which juxtaposes the natural beauty of the island with the lurking menace, sets the tone beautifully.\n- Short’s use of historical details, like the Prohibition-era smuggling operations, enriches the narrative.\n\nCritique: In some instances, the lyrical style detracts from the immediacy of the action. A more streamlined approach during climactic scenes would amplify their impact.\n\nFinal Verdict: A Richly Layered Mystery Worth Exploring\n\nTrouble Island is an evocative, suspenseful tale that lingers in the reader’s mind. Sharon Short’s vivid prose, complex characters, and historical depth make this a standout entry in the mystery genre. While it stumbles in pacing and the resolution of certain subplots, its strengths far outweigh its flaws.\n\nFor readers seeking a locked-room mystery with a historical twist, Trouble Island delivers a gripping experience that combines atmospheric storytelling with keen psychological insight. Sharon Short’s standalone debut marks a promising expansion of her repertoire, leaving fans eager for what she will tackle next.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Trouble Island is a suspense novel inspired by real events in the author's family. Set on a remote island in Lake Erie in 1932, the story follows Aurelia, a woman hiding from her past as a gangster's wife. When her friend Rosita disappears and Aurelia finds her body, she must navigate a web of secrets and lies as she tries to escape the island during an ice storm. The novel is a gripping locked room mystery and a powerful portrait of a woman in crisis.\n\nIt's hard to believe that this is a debut novel. The book is incredibly well-written, clever and captivating. I wasn't sure what to expect, as historical fiction can sometimes be hit or miss.\n\nThe main character is complex, with secrets and flaws, yet you can't help but root for her. The other characters are slowly introduced, but it's easy to keep track of them.\n\nThe environment described in the book is chilling and dark, drawing us closer to the events on the island. This book truly lives up to the term \"unputdownable.\"\n\nI was fortunate enough to receive both a digital and audiobook copy of the book. The narrator did an excellent job of keeping me engaged and truly bringing the story to life. The experience was unexpected, and I believe the choice of narrator was top-notch.\n\nThe story feels realistic and not far-fetched, offering a refreshing change for the upcoming season. If you enjoy books that delve into real events, gangsters, secrets, and secluded places, then this book is must-read. Don't miss out on this truly unique story!\n\nExcuse me now, as I need to warm up after feeling like I was on the island with Aurelia and swimming in the cold lake with her...\n\nThank you, St. Martin's Press | Minotaur Books and Macmillan Audio for the digital ARC copy. I am leaving this review voluntarily.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "Trouble Island by Sharon Short was both suspenseful and very engaging. It was the first book that I have read by Sharon Short and her first standalone novel. Sharon Short based Trouble Island on a place that actually existed and on events that occurred in her own family. Trouble Island was a well written historical fiction mystery. The setting was an old and secluded family owned mansion located in Lake Erie. The mansion was both well hidden and hard to detect unless its existence was already known to those in its vicinity. It took place in the early 1930’s when prohibition was strictly enforced which made bootlegging lucrative and popular. I listened to the audiobook that was well narrated by Jennifer Jill Araya and I alternately read some parts on my kindle.\n\nAurelia Escalante had met Rosita and Eddie McGee through her gangster husband who worked for Eddie McGee in his organization. Rosita and Aurelia forged a relationship almost immediately after meeting. It was no wonder that Aurelia sought out Rosita’s help when she found herself in a very serious situation. Rosita convinced her husband, Eddie, to help her help Aurelia disappear and escape scrutiny from the law. Aurelia was transported to Trouble Island and became Rosita’s maid and confident. Their relationship changed drastically after the tragic death of her young son. After Rosita’s young and innocent son was killed in the crossfire that was meant for Eddie, Rosita was never the same person she once was. Her son’s death crippled her. Rosita hardly ever left her room after his death and she started to keep her face concealed by a veil.\n\nAurelia had been on Trouble Island for close to a year at this point. She started to contemplate her escape. After all, Trouble Island was not far from Ohio. How hard could it be to reach the shore of Ohio from Trouble Island? Aurelia had saved some money but the discovery of a treasure box early one morning while she returned from her usual early morning swim definitely bolstered her confidence that she could indeed escape. She found a place to hide her treasure until she was ready to retrieve it and leave the island for good. Before Aurelia was able to put her plan into action, a few unexpected things occurred. First of all, Eddie unexpectedly arrived at Trouble Island with an entourage of dangerous men. Eddie had come back to Trouble Island to convince Rosita to sell the island and their mansion to the man that had been responsible for her son’s death. Eddie had acquired insurmountable debts and this was his solution to fixing his problems. Of course, Rosita was adamant about not selling the house that had been in her family for generations and especially to the murderer of her son. Then Rosita disappeared. Despite Rosita’s disappearance, Aurelia was still determined to escape from Trouble Island. As she was putting her plan into motion, she discovered Rosita’s dead body in Lake Erie. Someone had strategically placed Rosita’s body where Aurelia would surely find her and make Aurelia look as if she had caused her death. As Aurelia tried to prove her innocence, more dead bodies were found. Can Aurelia figure out who was responsible for all the deaths? Would she be forced to reveal her secrets? Will Aurelia be able to escape from Trouble Island?\n\nTrouble Island by Sharon Short was an intense locked-in mystery with just enough twists and turns to keep me guessing. The ending was satisfying and I was a bit surprised by it. I enjoyed reading the author’s note at the conclusion and learning that the story was based on things that occurred in her own family. Trouble Island included many secrets, some romance, a cast of colorful characters, a setting that fit with the events of the story and several twists and turns. I enjoyed both listening and reading Trouble Island by Sharon Short and highly recommend it.\n\nThank you to Macmillan Audio and Minotaur Books for allowing me to listen and read Trouble Island by Sharon Short through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Trouble Island\nBy: Sharon Short\nPub Date: December 3, 2024\nPublisher: Minotaur Books, Macmillan Audio\n\nThe setting is Trouble Island in the middle of Lake Erie.

        "Review 8": "Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for the eARC in exchange for my honest review.\n\nTrouble Island was an engaging read that kept my interest. I enjoyed the simplicity of a single timeline told from a single perspective. It's soon apparent that Trouble Island, as both a title for the book and the name of the fictional island on Lake Erie, is more apt for the description of the group of characters who make up the cast. All are deeply troubled, all fighting their own personal fight, and some do so against each other. If you enjoy a locked room mystery you'll probably rate this a 5. I'm not a massive fan of that premise, as I have mentioned in reviews for other titles, but Trouble Island avoids some of the typical clichés those stories get sucked into.\n\n4 out of 5.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "I’d read the teaser of Trouble Island in the Minotaur Sampler 12, and was delighted to read the entire book shortly thereafter because I just had to know who committed the murder and why! Trouble Island by Sharon Short is a suspenseful whodunit murder mystery with plenty of plot twists to keep the reader guessing until the very end. If you loved playing the board game Clue as a kid, then you’ll love this story set on an isolated Canadian Island on Lake Erie during a bitter Winter storm with an oddly matched group of guests including gangsters during Prohibition, all with motives of course.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for the eARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are mine alone.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "In Lake Erie, a watery border between Canada and the United States, lies Trouble Island. The forty-six acre island was a stopping place for escaped slaves and military runaways fleeing the states enroute to Canada during the Civil War. Like all islands, it has seen its fair share of storms.\n\nWe join the residents of Trouble Island in 1931, during the Prohibition era. A time of gangsters, molls, mobs, and goons. We meet Rosita McGee, the wife of a gangster, and the owner of the island. Rosita is in mourning for her her four year old son Oliver, who was killed in the crossfire of a gang altercation. She blames her husband Eddie for his death and they have been estranged since it happened.\n\nAlso, we meet the protagonist and sole narrator of this novel, Aurelia Escalante (aka Susan Walker). Aurelia is an enigmatic character. Once friends with Rosita and the wife of a gangster's goon, she murdered him when she could no longer withstand his constant abuse. Now, she is hiding out on the island posing as a maid to Rosita. Their friendship has withered and now Auriela is uncertain as to her status in this strange household. In her free time, Auriela watches and takes notes on the birds who reside and/or visit the island.\n\nAlso, Auriela cares for the bird of the now deceased little boy, Oliver. The bird, a blue and yellow macaw, is called Largo. I felt that Largo symbolized innocence and freedom in a place that had little of each commodity.\n\nWe meet the black couple who help to run the old mansion on Trouble Island. Henry is the cook and handyman, while his wife Maxine works as the housekeeper.\n\nWe meet Seamus Grover, one of the bodyguards, who Aurelia is attracted to.\n\nEveryone on Trouble Island is harbouring secrets of their own, including Auriela.\n\nWhen Rosita's estranged husband, gangster Eddie McGee and his right-hand man, Cormac Herlihy make a surprise visit to Trouble Island with a doctor, a starlet (who is Rosita's cousin), and a movie star in tow, events on the island take a drastic turn for the worse. Allegiances are tested and found to be constantly shifting, the mansion is sabotaged, there are murders...\n\nWho is to be trusted? Tension and unsettling undercurrents permeate the island.\n\nWith themes of avarice, corruption, shame, guilt, betrayal, vengeance, and what it means to be free, this novel was a compelling fictional snapshot into a time period that I personally have read little about. The author notes that this novel was based upon true events from her own family history.\nShow more"

While the tale does begin on a cruise ship near Puerto Rico, in this case I don’t think they accurately represent the story. A better title would have been Return to Me, taken from a poem read near the end of the novel, which has multiple shades of meaning for this book.\n\nI would have lived more detailed descriptions of the lush Puerto Rican island as well as the small “nothing” town in Oregon where Gracie and Meg grow up.\n\nThese are small issues, however, overall.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nHighly recommended.

        "Review 2": "Thank you to NetGalley and Kensington Publishing for an advanced electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!\n\nShort version: I loved this and will read anything that Lauren E Rico writes.\n\nEmilia and Paul are newlyweds in their early twenties, having just eloped and hopped on a cruise ship to celebrate. Two nights in, after a stop in Puerto Rico, Paul is missing, and Emilia is concerned, but nobody will take her seriously. She calls his parents, the Winsteads, because she knows their money will get things moving, but instead, they shift the blame to Emilia and try to get her arrested and charged with Paul's disappearance. Her only option is to disappear herself and hope the Winsteads never come looking for her.\n\nThirty years later, Emilia receives word that Paul might be alive and living in Puerto Rico. She immediately hops on a plane to follow that lead. Not having previously known about this aspect of their mother's past, her two adult daughters, Meg and Gracie, follow her.\n\nThis is a story of mystery and love. Family and the strength of connection. Seeing parts of people that you may not have ever seen in such a way.

        "Review 6": "2.5 ⭐️\n\ni felt like this had so much potential and could have made a great story, but the writing was pretty juvenile and the characters were almost emotionally immature in both the past and present. the plot was good, but just felt the premise fell flat.",
        "Review 7": "Lauren E. Rico's \"After the Ocean\" is a deeply moving exploration of family secrets, lost love, and the ripple effects of decisions made in desperate times. The novel masterfully weaves together multiple timelines and perspectives, creating a rich tapestry of interconnected lives affected by one pivotal moment - the disappearance of Paul Winstead from a honeymoon cruise thirty years ago.\n\nRico's writing style is fluid and engaging, with a particular talent for crafting authentic dialogue that reveals character depth while moving the story forward. The author demonstrates remarkable skill in handling multiple point-of-view characters, seamlessly transitioning between perspectives without losing narrative momentum.\n\nCharacter Development & Relationships\n\nThe heart of the story lies in its well-drawn characters and their complex relationships:\n\n- Emilia/Emily: A woman who sacrificed everything to protect her unborn child, living decades under an assumed identity. Her character arc from frightened young bride to protective mother to woman reclaiming her past is compelling and believable.\n\n- Gracie: The daughter who inherited more than just her father's looks - her drive, perfectionism, and struggle with relationships mirror both her biological parents in unexpected ways.\n\n- Meg: The younger daughter whose musical talent echoes her mother's abandoned dreams, wrestling with expectations and her own desires.\n\nRico excels at portraying the intricate dynamics between mothers and daughters, sisters, and family members separated by secrets and circumstances.\n\nThematic Elements & Emotional Depth\n\nThe novel explores several profound themes:\n\n- The weight of family secrets and their generational impact\n- The complexity of forgiveness and redemption\n- The nature of identity and how it shapes our relationships\n- The power of music as both healing force and emotional conduit\n\nSetting & Atmosphere\n\nRico's portrayal of Puerto Rico is vivid and authentic, using the island's beauty and culture as more than just backdrop. The contrast between the sun-drenched beaches and dark family secrets creates an effective atmospheric tension throughout the narrative.\n\nCritical Analysis\n\nStrengths\n\n- Complex, well-developed characters\n- Masterful handling of multiple timelines\n- Rich cultural elements and setting details\n- Emotionally resonant exploration of family dynamics\n- Effective use of music as both plot device and metaphor\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\n- Some plot revelations feel slightly telegraphed\n- The pacing occasionally slows in the middle sections\n- A few secondary characters could be more fully developed\n- Certain coincidences stretch credibility\n\nImpact & Literary Merit\n\nThe novel stands out in the contemporary mystery thriller genre for its emotional depth and complex character work. While it contains elements of traditional suspense, it transcends genre conventions to deliver a powerful meditation on love, loss, and redemption.\n\nCultural & Social Context\n\nRico handles themes of class prejudice, cultural identity, and family expectations with sensitivity and nuance. The portrayal of Puerto Rican culture and the immigrant experience adds depth to the narrative without falling into stereotypes.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\n\"After the Ocean\" is a compelling and emotionally resonant novel that succeeds on multiple levels. While some plot elements occasionally strain credibility, the strength of the character work and emotional authenticity carry the story. Rico has crafted a moving exploration of family, identity, and the power of love to transcend time and tragedy.\n\nWhy Not 5 Stars?\n\nWhile \"After the Ocean\" is a strong novel with many admirable qualities, a few elements prevent it from achieving perfection:\n\n- Some plot conveniences that strain credibility\n- Occasional pacing issues\n- A few underdeveloped secondary characters\n\nThese minor flaws don't significantly detract from the novel's emotional impact and overall quality, but they do leave room for improvement in Rico's future works.\n\nConclusion\n\n\"After the Ocean\" is a compelling addition to the contemporary mystery thriller genre that prioritizes emotional depth and character development over mere plot twists. Rico has crafted a moving exploration of family bonds, lost love, and the possibility of second chances that will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page.\n\nThe novel's greatest strength lies in its authentic portrayal of complex family relationships and the ways in which secrets and unspoken truths can shape lives across generations. While some plot elements might stretch credibility, the emotional truth at the heart of the story remains powerful and convincing.\n\nRecommended for readers who appreciate character-driven narratives that blend elements of mystery with deeper explorations of family dynamics and personal identity. Rico has established herself as a voice to watch in contemporary fiction.\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "What in the ever-loving fudge did I just read?!? I mean, the blurb told me exactly what this book was going to be about so I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I absolutely did not expect it to be so dark. If you're going into this one planning to read about a benignly meddlesome old woman and a mischievous young boy playing harmless pranks on each other, well … it's certainly not that. Which I guess is a good thing, because that sounds like a boring read now that I think about it. Havoc is a lot of things, but boring is not one of them.\n\nOur narrator is Maggie, a nosy octogenarian who has taken it upon herself to “fix” other people's lives, even if they haven't exactly asked for her help. She's already fled one hotel in Europe due to her meddling taking an unexpected turn. She's unlikeable and unreliable and should probably be in some sort of retirement home with locks on the outside of the doors. What will happen when Maggie pits herself against someone who's just as awful as she is? And what if that person just happens to be an eight-year-old boy?\n\nIt's probably best if you go into this book mostly blind, but I will reiterate that this is a dark (and insane) read. It starts off fairly tame and then goes completely off the rails. You can feel the tension build as you turn the pages. And then the ending is kind of insane but also kind of brilliant and I am not exactly sure how I should feel about any of it.\n\nMy overall rating: 4.45 stars, rounded down. If you like twisted and suspenseful tales narrated by awful old women with a whole host of personality disorders, definitely consider giving this one a read. It's a wild ride.\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and Harper for providing me with an advance copy of this book to review. Its expected publication date is December 3, 2024.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "4.5 stars:\n\nIs protagonist Maggie Burkhardt an unreliable narrator? Is she just a busy body who thinks highly of herself? Author Christopher Bollen must have had a lot of fun characterizing Maggie, as she is a handful!\n\nMaggie is an octogenarian widow from Wisconsin, who left six years ago after her beloved husband, Peter, died. Covid has limited international travel, and Maggie is caught in the travel chaos, but she’s fine with that. She intends to live out the rest of her life, here in Luxor Egypt at the Royal Karnak Palace Hotel. Prior to the Royal Karnak, she’d been in 18 hotels. The Royal Karnak is perfect for her. She states, “Despite the unseasonable heat and the return of my uncontrollable compulsion, I have been extremely happy at the Royal Karnak.”\n\nBollen drops other hints that Maggie might be a bit daft; or is she Machiavellian? She enjoys interfering in other’s lives, and she states, “I change people’s lives for the better. Only once did my actions end for the worst. But I don’t like to think about the murder.” She deems herself as a “fixer” of people’s unhappiness. She plays the “I’m all alone and elderly” card well, and she uses that MO to infiltrate other’s lives. One of her intrusions resulted in her needing to make a hasty exit from Switzerland. Egypt is one of the few countries who accepted travelers, which is how she ended up in Luxor.\n\nMaggie is enjoying her stay, feeling comfortable in her prying. She befriends a couple, one an archaeologist. The husband finds himself charmed by a young boy , Otto, who arrived with his mother. Otto is the only child in the hotel, and he comes across charming. Maggie is not amused by Otto and finds him a nuisance. Maggie schemes to try and get his mother to return with Otto to Paris, where Otto’s father is working on a film. Otto sees through her antics; now Otto sets his sights on Maggie. Only Bollen would make an 8 year-old boy a nemesis to an octogenarian!\n\nNow we have an eight-year-old boy who matches wits with an 81 year-old woman. Otto is diabolical with his innocent boy shtick. Bollen expertly sets the scenes which make it easy to be fully invested in the story. Both Maggie and Otto are unlikable, yet the writing is so good that you want to see how this could possible end!\n\nI listened to the audio, 11 hours long. Maggi-Meg Reed narrates the book. I enjoyed her performance.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Maggie Burkhardt finds solace amid the pandemic at the Royal Karnak Palace Hotel in Egypt. She spends her days reminiscing about her deceased husband and her daughter that also died much too young leaving Maggie alone in the world. Since their passing she has traveled throughout Europe. Before making her way to Egypt she was in Sweden where a tragedy sent her fleeing in the night to her new found safe place.\n\nOnce she's settled in this meddlesome octogenarian has finally met her match with the arrival of new guests, Tessa, and her 8 year old son, Otto.\n\nOtto, with his mismatched eyes, seems to see who Maggie really is which will set these two down a path of destruction.\n\nThis book definitely had it's ups and downs. There were parts that really drew my interest and other parts that I skimmed in boredom. Maggie was quite the character and she will have you cringing throughout the entire book. The latter half of the book does ramp up in both suspense and darkness and the ending was delightfully twisted which made this a worthwhile reading experience for me. 4 stars!\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Harper for my complimentary copy.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "An interesting idea to confront a lady in her 80s and a young boy as adversaries, and for the reader to guess who the reliable character is. The plot did not keep me on the edge of my sofa, however, I expected an unexpected, and was rewarded in a way in the final moments.\nNot especially engaging, HAVOC is a decent audiobook, and the narrator does a great job using two different ways of interpreting the inner Maggie, who is the narrator, and the way she addresses her interlocutors.\n*Many thanks to Christopher Bollen, HarperCollins UK, and NetGalley for a free adudiobook in exchange for my honest review.*\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "What a twisted, twisted tale! Part The Bad Seed and part a well-played long-game, Havoc pulled me in initially with its evocative prose. Expanding from there, Maggie came to life right before my eyes through an impressive character study that had me hating “the boy” more and more with each page. It was, however, the dark, evil escalations between the old and the young that truly got my attention. All I can say is this was one wild ride. So much so, in fact, that I’d happily take it again if I was gifted with a much wanted sequel.\n\nWhile the plot was—for the most part—exactly what I was expecting after reading the synopsis, the unlikeable characters and rising foreboding had me flying through the pages. By the time I reached the downright shocking conclusion, however, my armchair-sleuthing-self was calling out suggestions. Was Otto really what he seemed? Was Maggie hiding something much darker in her mysterious past? It wasn’t until the last few chapters, though, that all was revealed. And let me tell you, it totally lived up to—and surpassed—all of my guesses.\n\nThe only piece to the puzzle that drove me a bit nutty were the somewhat dry, extraneous descriptions that set me skimming here and there. After all, while they did manage to set the scene to perfection, they also called into existence every painting and rug in the molding old-world hotel. Once I raced through the slow burn start, however, my eye was drawn to the ratcheting suspense and tit-for-tat dramatics between Maggie and Otto over every mildly boring detail.\n\nAll in all, I found the overall plot to be more psychological drama than suspense or thriller. With morally gray characters, acute psychological insight, and an underlying claustrophobic and sinister vibe, it was a doozy of a read. At the same time, I wish there had been more to the finale. Not because it was missing anything exactly, but because I just wanted—well—more. So if you love a wicked child and a climax that delivers a shock to the system, definitely give this book a go. Just expect a slower pace and you should be golden. Rating of 4 stars.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nEighty-one-year-old widow Maggie Burkhardt came to the Royal Karnak to escape. But not in quite the same way as most other guests who are relaxing at this threadbare luxury hotel on the banks of the Nile. Maggie, a compulsive fixer of other people’s lives, may have found herself in hot water at her last hotel in Switzerland and just might have needed to get out of there fast... But here at the Royal Karnak, under the hot Saharan sun, she has a comfortable suite, a loyal confidante in the hotel manager, Ahmed, and a handful of sympathetic friends, similar “long-termers” who understand her still-vivid grief for her late husband, Peter. Here, she is merely the sweet old lady in Room 309.\n\nOne morning, however, Maggie notices a new arrival at check-in: a mournful-looking young mother named Tess and her impish eight-year-old, Otto. Eager to help, Maggie invites them into her world. But it isn’t long before Maggie realizes that in her longing to be a part of their family, she has let in an enemy much stronger than she bargained for. In scrawny, homely Otto, Maggie Burkhardt has finally met her match.\n\nThank you to Christopher Bollen and Harper Books for my complimentary copy.

        "Review 6": "HELLO DOLLY meets THE OMEN meets WHITE LOTUS in what is probably my favorite psychological thriller of the year. This is truly unhinged in all the best ways (I mean, did you see my comps!?), and Bollen does a terrific job slowly tightening the screws on his readers up until the final gut-churning moment. Well done, sir.",
        "Review 7": "A really well-done piece of literary suspense a la Highsmith, although for some reason it took me an inordinately long time to get through the first half - but then I raced through the rest in one day. There were some clunky passages here and there, and not everything seemed to quite 'fit'; I noticed that Maggie's details about her daughter Julia kept seeming to change willy-nilly (at one point she says she died in childhood, and then the next that she died only a few years back, so ostensibly in her late 50's) - but this ultimately is resolved. The ending is both satisfying, unforeseen, and yet relies on a rather hackneyed, overused reason for all the mayhem \nchildhood sexual abuse. Still, I think this would make a corker of a film - Kathy Bates, call your agent STAT!\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "Maggie hides a lot and does a lot and leaves out a lot and says a lot. We have to nitpick our way through what she tells us and what we see happening and make up the story as we go along as leaving it to Maggie would not do.\n\nUnfortunately, Maggie has the desire to meddle, to make right for what to her is wrong. It is only at the end that we see why this is but then it was rather too late for me. When the denouement came, I had rather lost my empathy and care.\n\nAn ARC kindly provided by author/publisher via Netgalley.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "3.5/5\n\nHavoc is a dark, clever, and oddly funny psychological thriller set in a crumbling Luxor hotel during the pandemic. Maggie Burkhardt, an 81-year-old widow from Wisconsin, spends her days helping people. Well, at least that’s what she believes - her version of help usually results in chaos and ruined lives.\n\nIn Luxor, she found a home. Things are going great until she meets Otto, an 8-year-old boy staying at the hotel with his mother. Otto may look harmless, but he’s sharp, sneaky, and eager to stir up trouble. What starts as a petty standoff between them turns into a dark and dangerous game. Bollen nicely balances the tension with wit and humor, and that makes the story surprisingly entertaining.\n\nMaggie’s sharp opinions about the surrounding people are amusing, and her narration is excellent. The pandemic’s isolation and her loneliness also play a big role, making her perspective twisted and her obsession with Otto even more believable-if not excusable. Is she reliable? Doubtful, but you’ll do best to see for yourself.\n\nNow, while the story has plenty of suspense, the ending feels…unfinished. I have a few lingering questions about Maggie’s past, and the final payoff isn’t as strong as it could be.\n\nUltimately, I liked Havoc despite its flaws. It’s a unique read, especially if you like dark thrillers with a side of dark humor and moral ambiguity.\n\nAudiobook narration: enjoyable.\n\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway contest in exchange for an honest review. Maggie Burkhart, eighty-one-year-old widow, has been living at the Royal Karnak Palace Hotel in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic for the past three months. Unfortunately, Maggie has a bad habit of interfering into other people's relationships. For example, she steals a yellow scarf from the hotel room from a beautiful, single,  Greek tourist and places it in another couples bed, thus causing rife in the marriage. Regrettably, Otto, an intelligent eight-year-old boy, sees her and blackmails her. Sadly, the vicious pranks they exchange become increasingly horrible. I finally had to stop reading when Maggie left the door open to the three cockatiels during the night, and a stray cat slaughtered them. This is a great book for anyone who loves psychological thriller. But, I have to be honest, being an animal lover, the image of the killed birds really turned me off. "

        "Review 1": "If you enjoy atmospheric southern cozy mysteries, then this debut and first novel in the Old Juniper Bookstore Mysteries may be the book for you. Booked for Murder by P. J. Nelson features Madeline Brimley returning to her hometown of Enigma, Georgia when she inherits the bookstore after her aunt Ruby dies.\n\nMadeline left Enigma to go to college and then follow her stage acting dreams in New York and Atlanta. The bookstore is in an old Victorian mansion with living quarters on the second floor. But restarting her life isn’t going to be easy. A fire and a threatening phone call don’t deter her, but when a second fire, a murder, and another threatening call occurs, she knows she needs to find the killer.\n\nMadeline is outgoing, tends to do foolhardy things, and doesn’t feel at home anywhere. The other characters have some depth and I would expect more in future books for the recurring characters.\n\nThe premise was great and I enjoyed meeting Gloria, the priest of the nearby church, Philomena, who was Aunt Roses’s friend and someone Madeline knew from her childhood, and David, the handyman. However, the pacing was a little slow for me. There are several sub-plots that impact the overall flow, but add another dimension to the narrative. I enjoyed the literary and movie references throughout the story. My biggest quibble is its predictability, including the identity of the murderer reasonably early in the novel, leading to a sparsity of suspense. However, there were plenty of conflicts, secrets, and humor to go with threads of murder, grief, forgiveness, resentment, gossip, amateur sleuthing, and self-reflection.\n\nOverall, this enjoyable mystery was full of unique characters and was very atmospheric. It’s a good start to the series.\n\nSt. Martin’s Press, Minotaur Books and P. J. Nelson provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. The publication date is currently set for December 10, 2024.\n----------------------------------------\nMy 3.21 rounded to 3 stars review is coming soon.",
        "Review 2": "NetGalley had a new author release last month with P.J. Nelson's Booked for Murder, an amateur sleuth series set in the south. Madeline, a mid 30s (with premature graying hair) returns to take over her late aunt's book store only to discover someone else wants to keep her away. Fires. Murder. Drugs. Lots of darkness for a cozy but handled well. I like Madeline a lot, and the story has been set up with a balanced supporting cast. I won't share much as its the first book, so you never know if one of them turns out to be the villain. I like how things are set up for a possible romantic triangle, a mentor relationship, and a connection to the local liberal arts college. For such a small town, there is a lot of drama, I will say, but that's what makes for a good read.",
        "Review 3": "BOOKED FOR MURDER (Old Juniper Bookstore Mysteries Book #1) by P.J. Nelson is the first book in a new cozy mystery series set in small-town Georgia. Madeline Brimley has returned to her hometown after a less than prosperous career on the stage to inherit her beloved Aunt Rose’s old Victorian mansion which contains a bookstore on the first floor, living quarters upstairs, and it was her childhood escape as she grew up. Immediately on her return the gazebo is burned down in her backyard, and she begins to get threatening phone calls telling her to leave. When she does not leave, another fire is set and a dead body is found in the bookstore.\n\nThere are several places that I felt like stopping, but I carried on to the end. The mystery plotline itself kept me reading and was well developed and had a good resolution. It was the characters that gave me the problems with this story. I never took to Madeline with her snap decisions, placing herself in danger unnecessarily more than once, and not involving the police because she felt they were not up to the job. The other characters felt more like caricatures that made questionable decisions and did not feel fully developed. Overall, this was just an O.K. read for me.",
        "Review 4": "**3.5-stars rounded up**\n\n📚♥️📚♥️📚♥️📚♥️📚♥️📚♥️📚♥️📚\n\nBooked for Murder is the 1st-book in the Old Juniper Bookstore Mysteries series. This is a new Cozy Mystery series set in a small Georgia town.\n\nIn this, we meet Madeline Brimley, who has just returned to her hometown of Enigma, Georgia, after the passing of her Aunt Rose, her dearest remaining relative.\n\n\n\n\nMaddy has mixed feelings about going back. She always dreamed of leaving Enigma and heading to NYC, as an actress, to follow in her Aunt Rose's footsteps, actually. Things in New York were tough though, and she actually ended up in the Theater circuit in Atlanta instead.\n\nEven though Atlanta isn't quite what she dreamed, it's better than Enigma, and now she has to go back. Aunt Rose left Madeline her property, including her bookstore, the Old Juniper, which caters to the local college students.\n\n\n\n\nAlmost as soon as Madeline arrives back, though, things start going wrong. First, the long-standing and well-loved gazebo in the back yard is set ablaze, and then Madeline starts receiving disturbing calls from someone threatening her unless she leaves.\n\nMadeline isn't one to be easily intimidated however, so the calls and fire end up having the opposite effect, making her dig in even more.\n\nShe befriends a local student, Tandy, who seems to have also been quite close with Aunt Rose. Tandy inserts herself into helping with the bookstore, for which Maddy is grateful. That is until the next fire, that ultimately ends in murder.\n\n\n\n\nNot fully trusting the local authorities, and also feeling slightly guilty over the violent death which took place in the bookstore, Maddy begins an investigation of her own.\n\nWill she be able to find out who is after her, or will they end up getting to her first? It seems they've tried to kill already. The next time, they may actually be successful.\n\n\n\n\nThis was a fun start to new Cozy Mystery series. I did enjoy the bookshop setting and the small town Georgia feels. I listened to the audibook, and the narrator did a great job channeling some accents that felt true to the story.\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure I was going to vibe with Maddy. She can be a little abrasive and off-putting at times. It almost felt at certain points that she was completely unreasonable and condescending to those around her, but I think it's all just an intentional part of her character journey.\n\nShe did become more likable over the course of the book and I started to understand where she was coming from the more I learned about her.\n\n\n\n\nThere was also a nice mix of side characters, Gloria, the reverend of a nearby church being my favorite, as well as a potential love interest for Maddy.\n\nI feel like Nelson did a solid job setting up the small town atmosphere, as well as providing plenty of room for Maddy, as well as this series, to grow moving forward. I would definitely be interested in reading more mysteries centered around the Old Juniper Bookstore.\n\n\n\n\nThank you to the publisher, Dreamscape Media, for providing me with a copy to read and review. I would def recommend the audio format if you are interested in picking this one up!",
        "Review 5": "I was attracted by the colourful, eye-catching cover and that it would be a cozy mystery set in a small southern town. I prefer complex mysteries that involve police procedurals, but I thought a charming, cozy mystery would be the break I needed. This was a darker read than I expected; the excitement arose at a slow pace, but overall, it was a quick, light read. Unfortunately, the small town had its secrets, and the townspeople and the southern atmosphere were not always shown in a positive light. The premise was intriguing, but the twists were predictable. Most characters were quirky, and I felt their personalities could be better developed.  Madeline Brimley returns to the small town of Enigma, Georgia, where she grew up and left at age seventeen to pursue an acting career. She was on the stage in Atlanta and NYC but never was a big-time success. Now in her mid-30s, Prospective acting roles are declining. She learns that she has inherited the Old Juniper Bookstore from her eccentric Aunt Rose back in her hometown. She has fond memories of visiting her aunt in the old Victorian mansion and enjoying the haphazard arrangement of books of every variety in each downstairs room. The living quarters were upstairs. Madeline feels this would be a great place to relax and plan her future.  As soon as Madeline arrives at the Enigma home, the gazebo in the backyard is set afire. Instead of calling the fire department, she tries to put it out herself. She receives a threatening phone call, warning her to leave immediately or the bookstore/house would be burned down with her inside. There is another call, but Madeline refuses to inform the police of the threats. She distrusts them and considers them inefficient. She considers the warnings to be a nasty prank. She cannot sell the property until she lives there for six months. She is befriended by Philomena, an elderly friend of her late aunt. Phil is a psychology professor at the local college. From some of her comments, I wondered if the police would have a better understanding of the criminal mind. Another friend is Gloria, an Episcopal clergy and neighbour. They are ready with advice and help when the story takes a shocking turn.  The most likable person in the story is a sweet young woman, Tandy, who had worked in the bookstore and helped the aunt around the house. Madeline was amazed when she allowed Tandy to spend a couple of hours in the store; she attracted more sales and a higher profit than expected. The college students buy many books for their courses, and some older books sell for a hefty profit. Tandy pleads to stay the night, having been accustomed to doing so when the aunt was alive. When Tandy cooks gourmet meals for Madeline, plus her childhood favourites, she is very welcome to stay whenever she pleases.  The bookstore is set ablaze, and Tandy is found murdered inside. Madeline, Gloria and Philomena band together to solve the killing and arson. Madeline jumps to conclusions, makes risky decisions, and is brash and defensive. She appears to consider herself superior to the townspeople. She fails to see that the murder of Tandy was a mistake and that the death was meant for her. There are several suspects considered by the group, and it is learned that the solution lies in the dark secrets in the town, and Aunt Rose had hidden information unknown to Madeline and others. There is a touch of romance before the crimes are solved. The ending leaves room for a future sequel that I would want to read. I would hope it would be set in the same location and with the return of the major characters. I would prefer that Madeline be less annoying. Recommended for readers who enjoy a cozy mystery, especially one in a small town in the south, and would like a mystery involving amateur sleuths with little police involvement. 'Booked for Murder' is due to be published on December 10.",
        "Review 6": "(3.5 stars, rounded up)\nBooked For Murder was a good start to a new cozy mystery series set in a small town in Georgia. Madeline Brimley’s career as an actress hadn’t really gone anywhere, so when she inherited a house and bookstore from her beloved aunt Rose, she moved back to her hometown. No sooner does she get there than the large gazebo out back is set on fire! On top of that, she received a couple of threats over the phone. Someone doesn’t want Madeline to take over that bookstore. A couple of nights later, the store is indeed set on fire and a young college student is stabbed. Madeline, after recovering from her shock, sets out to figure out who murdered her new young friend.\n\nI didn’t find Madeline particularly lovable, but that’s not a requirement. She does need to get with the 21st century and get herself a cell phone, though! I did really enjoy the character of Gloria, the fairly new Episcopal priest in town. There are a couple of other interesting side characters who I hope will appear in further installments of this new series.\n\nThank you to Minotaur Books and NetGalley for the opportunity to read a review copy of this book. All opinions are my own.",
        "Review 7": "4.5 ⭐️: Booked for Murder is an enjoyable, cozy mystery that is the perfect listen to curl up with for the winter months with a cup of tea that you can get through in a day! The narration on the audiobook is excellent and really easy to understand and enjoy at 2x speed. Madeline Brimley is an interesting protagonist with a cast of charming and well developed side characters who round out the story without becoming overwhelming. This is, at its core, a mystery which I think is really important to remember because the characters are so interesting that I did hope for a bit more side-plot development, but the mystery in the novel is resolved in a very satisfying way. I would absolutely read more by this author! Grateful to Dreamscape Media for the early copy.",
        "Review 8": "Special thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a free, electronic ARC of this novel received in exchange for an honest review.\n\nExpected publication date: Dec. 10, 2024\n\nMadeleine Brimley left Enigma, Georgia years ago hoping to pursue her dream of being an actress. After time spent in New York City and then Atlanta doing just that, Madeleine is called back to Enigma when her Aunt Rose passes away, leaving Madeleine her beloved bookstore. Maddy returns, hoping to quickly sell the bookstore and move on, but stipulations in her aunt’s will make it so she has to stick around, at least for a short time. Reluctant, Madeleine reopens the bookstore but almost immediately she starts receiving threatening phone calls. Then, the gazebo on her property is burned down and a young woman who Maddy just hired to help out, is murdered. Madeleine can’t leave Enigma knowing that there is a murderer on the loose, and with the help of a few locals, and a giant cat, she sets out to solve the mystery.\n\nP.J. Nelson’s, “Booked for Murder” is a small-town mystery with eccentric but likable characters and, at the centre of it all, an old Victorian house that has been turned into a bookstore, with books in nearly every room (or, as I call it, my idea of paradise). Madeleine is a woman in her thirties, struggling as an “aging” actress, until she is forced to return to the hometown she couldn’t wait to leave. Overall, Maddy was a decent character and easy to connect with.\n\nThere were some odd language structures in this novel and I don’t know if it was done to reinforce the fact that the characters were from the South, or if it was just strangely written. Some conversations were awkward and redundant but luckily, the whole novel didn’t read that way so it was easy to overlook. Maddy’s two adult female neighbours assist in the investigation (although no real investigating takes place, it’s more of a “jump in headfirst and see what happens” type of thing) but, by far, my favourite character was the chunky, furry bookstore cat.\n\nThere was one part of the story that I found very difficult to wrap my head around. One of Maddy’s investigative partners is a psychology professor at the local college and yet, she asks Maddy what a “behaviour pattern” is (to which Maddy replies how it relates to acting and the theatre). I don’t assume that people from the South are less intelligent than people anywhere else (obviously) but I would be getting my money back from that college, for sure.\n\nThe conclusion of the mystery was well-developed, with the right amount of surprise and suspense. Although this specific mystery plotline was concluded, “Murder” has some questions that remain unanswered, which makes me question if this novel is the first in a series. As long as it takes place in a bookstore, and has a giant fluffy cat, I’ll read it, as those were by far the most appealing parts of the story.",
        "Review 9": "Exiting at 62%.The book stated out strong, with much better character development and observations than is typical for a cozy mystery. I found this a pleasant surprise and intriguing.However, my interest has flagged. Sadly, I just don’t care who killed Tandy at the bookstore or whether our heroine Madeleine was the intended target. There is also a side story about an “evil land developer” type that is a threat to the bookstore (so cliche).OF NOTE:Two other characters help Madeleine track down the murdered, arsonist, and the person making threatening phone calls. One is a chubby, short, crew cut wearing first female priest at a local church, who some call, “Father”. The other is dead Aunt Rose’s best friend Philomenia who not only happens to be the one whoburned down the bookstore’s historic gazebo, but, oh, was (surprise to Madeleine) was also Aunt Rose’s decades-long lover.CONCLUSION:If you’re super into cozy mysteries, then this might be your jam. Otherwise, there’s nothing that interesting here, and the portrayal of the bookstore and the Georgia setting is lackluster at best.",
        "Review 10": "Thank you to NetGalley for the eARC in exchange for an honest review.\n\nAs a fan of cozy mystery genre, I’ll just have to say, this book is bad. I was hoping for it to at least be mediocre, but no, it is bad. Especially considering the other cozy mystery releases this year, which have been quite fun.\n\nFirst things first, it did not start out well. No proper introduction aside from what we already know from the synopsis. This girl got to the house where her aunt left her bookshop after she died, and then there was a fire. A lot did not make sense here, because after the fire, the character did not even bother to inform anybody - I mean, seriously, do you have nobody in your life? Like at all? Not even to inform the lawyer who informed you that your aunt left all this for you? Fire is a serious thing, everybody takes this seriously even if the author wanted to paint this girl as some weird girl or whatever.\n\nIf we put all the beginnings that did not make sense aside, the pace and the writing got a little better. Another “big” thing happened next, where someone was actually murdered and there was another fire. Things still did not make sense after this and it was almost stupid. Someone was murdered! It doesn’t matter how small the town is, a detective and a medical examiner/coroner would come immediately and the next morning you do not just wake up and make coffee in the kitchen again. Someone will immediately start questioning you or - if you are severely injured or maybe mourning - they would at least start scheduling when they can talk to you. What were you doing when it happened? Did you hear anything? And tons of other questions. Just because the detective is someone you know, that does not mean you can just escape this process. You also don’t sit there and laugh with your friends afterwards. I feel like the author is trying too hard to make it “cozy” to the point it does not make sense and it is just stupid. I know it is fiction but please, have some common sense.\n\nAlso, if you are expecting a cozy mystery that would actually revolve around a bookshop and the books, you will be disappointed because the bookshop is mostly closed throughout the story to the point I am not sure why it is even titled “Booked for Murder”.\n\nOverall, this was a very disappointing read. It had the potential to be good, and there were times when I actually enjoyed some dialogue, but if I were to look at the whole book, it’s just not good. There are so many cozy mystery books available, and I don’t see why anyone should pick this up unless you get it for free. Or if you have nothing else to read."

        "Review 1": "Alex Segura’s Alter Ego dives into the comic book world, where Annie Bustamante—a big-shot filmmaker and comic artist—finally gets a shot at reviving her favorite superhero, the Lethal Lynx. But things get shady fast when the offer comes with strings attached, plus some creepy anonymous warnings to boot. Annie’s tired of cash grabs and ready to tell this story her way, no matter what dark secrets she uncovers.\n\nI've been wanting to read Alex Segura's books since his last book, Secret Identity, so I made sure to prioritize this one. You do not need to read Secret Identity to follow this book as I was easily able to follow. This book was such a freaking blast! I highly encourage you to listen to the audiobook as it felt like I was listening to a Marvel movie on my headphones. They really go the extra mile in this narration. This story really dives into the world of comics and superheroes, but also about mothers and daughters and some other themes throughout the story. If you like X-Men, Marvel, The Boys, or comics in general, Secrety Identity is a MUST READ. I cannot wait to read the next Alex Segura novel!\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "The saga of “The Legendary Lynx,” a lost comic book character from the 1970s, continues in this follow-up to 2022’s Secret Identity. This time, the troubled movie director and one-time famous comic book artist Annie Bustamante gets the chance to continue the story of the gritty urban heroine. The seedy owner of the reborn Triumph Comics wants a big Hollywood production after the comic comes out, and he partners her with a crazy, exiled, brilliant director. But resurrecting The Lynx is something some baddies are willing to kill for. A simple comic could result in murder.\n\nIt's a fine idea, one to which comic fans will be drawn. Segura does a good job of setting the stage in New York, unafraid to share the dirty, shameful shadows. There’s complexity to Annie, an interesting story filled with failure and success, and it’s easy to root for her. There’s a strong sense of feminism, too: the book seems to focus on Annie’s quest to protect the legacy of the character’s creator, the reclusive Carmen Valdez. The panels from the would-be comic book are fantastic.\n\n\n\n\nI like this theme a lot, and despite my rating or feelings, this is a series worth continuing. If anything, I might go read the comic book Segura plans to release in November: The Legendary Lynx. But I don’t want to blow up the guy's spot, so I’ll bury my negative comments deep, deep into the ocean floor of this review. Scroll WAAAAAAAAAY down either on Goodreads or my blog to find it, and I won’t post it to Instagram or NetGalley.

My thoughts:\n\nThe action promised on the first few pages dissolves into exposition for half the novel. Someone gets carjacked and murdered, then we get way too much backstory and office stuff.\n\nThe plot pieces were implausible, at least for me. I don’t think you can have it both ways: the Lynx can’t be this forgotten, edgy, iconic art piece from fifty years ago, while at the same time SO valuable that mobsters and ordinary businessmen are willing to kill for its ownership. How do they all know they’re going to make millions on a character so few people know about? Sure, if Batman disappeared for fifty years (don’t hold your breath), people would stab each other to recreate him. It’s not a perfect analogy, but look what happened to John Carter of Mars: only the die-hards knew who that was, so the movie flopped big-time.\n\nThe mystery was labyrinthine but hard to follow. In fact, it seemed the big conflict revolves around the ownership of the Lynx, which then means a lot of office-like squabbling. Board room meetings, tense as they are, do not a compelling mystery make. Annie’s obsession with Valdez seemed weird, not fascinating.\n\nThere are many, MANY time jumps, and while they’re clearly marked, there doesn’t seem to be a pattern or formula. They really slowed things down and didn't, IMHO, connect with the main storyline.\n\nSome characters don’t have a purpose, like Annie’s daughter: she seems like a tag-along, a connection between she and another writer / creator, but the poor kid gets no role in any of the action.\n\nAnd the danger seemed clumsy and weak. Worst. Assassins. Ever.\n\nIt felt like it needed another round of beta readers and a crack editor to help with the plot. Maybe someone to tell the author to focus on one storyline.\n\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "**4.5-stars**\n\nI adored Secret Identity when I read it back in 2022. It took me completely by surprise how invested I became in that story and the characters.\n\nLiterary Mysteries aren't necessarily a go-to genre for me. I do enjoy them from time-to-time, but I found Segura's noir-feeling writing style, as well as the back-drop of the comic book industry, absolutely enchanting.\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, I was stoked to hear about this sequel, Alter Ego. I listened to the audiobook, as I did with Secret Identity, and cannot recommend that format enough for both.\n\nIt's not just a reading. There are sound effects, and other enhancements, that make these books special productions indeed. Especially considering the comics aspect.\n\n\n\n\nOne big change is that this 2nd-book is set in the present day, whereas Secret Identity was set in the 1970s.\n\nAs you can imagine, the comic book industry has been through a lot of changes over that time period. I did slightly missed the backdrop of 70s-era NYC, NGL, but not enough to effect my overall rating.\n\nOur MC is Annie Bustamante, who is a successful filmmaker, author and illustrator. She's had many opportunities over her career, but perhaps the one that means the most is the one she has just been presented: the opportunity to bring back to life her longtime favorite superhero, the Lethal Lynx.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Annie is excited about the possibility of delivering the Lethal Lynx to a whole-new generation of superhero enthusiasts, she's not crazy about having to work with the people at Triumph Comics, including Bert Carlyle, whose father founded the company.\n\nFanning the flames of her uncomfortability, Annie begins receiving mysterious messages from an individual urging her to be careful, to trust no one.\n\nAll Annie's alert bells are going off and the more she digs into the history of the Lethal Lynx, the more she believes she may not know the whole story. But what sorts of secrets could be hidden within the comic book industry, and what would someone do to keep them hidden forever?\n\n\n\n\nThis was so good. I didn't love it quite to the same level as Secret Identity, but pretty darn close. I feel like some of my over-the-top joy with the first book was just how surprised I was by it. I knew more what to expect here.\n\nIMO though, this is such an underrated series. The concept is wildly-creative and interesting. I love the backdrop of the comic book industry and the ways it explores the role of the creatives within that space.\n\nI did love getting to know Annie in this story as well. She's a single-mom, who is talented and successful, yet still struggles with some aspects in her life, just like any other person. I liked how real she felt.\n\n\n\n\nI also appreciated how connected the novels felt. Even though they are separated by a fairly large span of time and follow different characters, the connections are there and I feel like they were so well done.\n\nI loved being reminded of little things that had happened in the first book and coming across various people who I remembered. I hadn't been expecting a sequel initially, so didn't brush up on the first book prior to picking this up.\n\nI didn't need too though, as Segura's execution was seamless transitioning between the two works. Even though this is its own, individual story, the influence from the first book was felt throughout and for me, provided great food for thought.\n\n\n\n\nIt was interesting to think about these kinds of art and intellectual property, and what happens to them over time. Who owns the rights and how they can be used. I feel like this may be an issue that is near and dear to Segura's heart, as it was certainly explored with care.\n\nThank you to the publisher, Macmillan Audio, for providing me with a copy to read and review. This was incredibly well done. I highly recommend this audio!!!\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "What a fun read! Thanks to Flatiron and Goodreads for this giveaway win.\nI really loved Annie’s character and the mystery of this world of comic books!",
        "Review 5": "As seen on www.mysteryandsuspense.com\n\n“Alter Ego” is a sharp and spellbinding mystery, set among the cutthroat world of comic book publishing. Alex Segura, author of the Pete Fernandez series of books as well as “Secret Identity”, the predecessor to “Ego”, has created an immersive environment with a tough-as-nails protagonist, Annie Bustamante.\n\nEver since she was a child, Annie has dreamed of creating her own comic books. A huge fan of “The Lethal Lynx”, Annie spends her days doodling and drawing up new plots for the series with her best friend, Danny. Years later, Annie is a single parent and a relative success in the movie industry, having left the comic book world behind. When the new owner of Triumph Entertainment, the company behind “The Lethal Lynx” reaches out to Annie to ask her to deliver a modernization of “Lynx”, Annie is over the moon. But she has been in the business too long to jump without doing her research and she soon finds out that anyone who has a connection to the Lynx, both now and in the past, is dead. Does Annie want to fulfill her childhood dream enough to risk her own life?\n\nSegura’s “Ego” is the second novel, a follow-up to “Secret Identity”, however it isn’t necessary to read the first novel at all, as “Ego” focuses on different protagonists and a different plot and, in fact, even takes place in a different time frame (“Identity” took place in the 1970s whereas “Ego” is modern day). Although there is some overlap in background characters and the environment itself, readers can expect to jump right in with “Ego” and not feel lost. In fact, you don’t even need to be a comic book fan to enjoy Segura’s latest.\n\nAnnie is a powerhouse worth cheering for. A single mother and recovering alcoholic, she has made her mark in the Hollywood film industry completely on her own merit. She is the farthest thing from naïve, and she takes no prisoners, even if they are smarmy titans of the entertainment world. She is a woman of morals and values, and her bravery and strength mirror the admirable traits of her hero, the Lynx.\n\n“Ego” is told in modern day, when Annie is raising her pre-teen daughter and is battling with the choice (and the Hollywood titans) to redo “Lynx”, and in the past, when we learn about Annie’s friendship over time with Danny, and how her love of comics grows hand-in-hand with her love for her best friend.\n\n“Ego” is an in-depth look behind the curtain of the comic book industry, which on its own is interesting, but the dark secrets, and the bodies that pile up, made me want to continue turning the pages. Segura’s “Ego” is a unique experience that stands out among the crowd.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "In Alter Ego, Alex Segura's follow-up to his LA Times Book Prize-winning Secret Identity, we return to the world of comic books - but this time through a contemporary lens that examines the collision between artistic integrity and corporate interests. While the first book introduced us to Carmen Valdez and her fight to claim ownership of the Lynx character in the 1970s, this sequel follows filmmaker and artist Annie Bustamante's modern-day struggle with similar themes, creating an intriguing parallel across decades.\n\nThe Story\n\nAnnie Bustamante is at a crossroads. A successful filmmaker with an Oscar nomination under her belt, she's reeling from her latest movie being shelved by the studio. When she's offered the chance to revive her beloved childhood comic book character, the Lynx, it seems like destiny - until the dark underbelly of the comics industry begins to surface. The offer comes from Bert Carlyle, son of Triumph Comics' founder, who partners her with controversial director Arturo Spinoza. As Annie digs deeper into the Lynx's history, she uncovers connections to her own past and a web of corruption that threatens not just her creative vision, but her life.\n\nStrengths\n\nSegura's intimate knowledge of the comics industry shines through in the authentic details and industry politics he portrays. The book excels at:\n\n- Capturing the passion and frustration of creators fighting for artistic control\n- Weaving together multiple timelines and perspectives seamlessly\n- Building tension through both personal and professional stakes\n- Creating complex, flawed characters with compelling motivations\n\nThe relationship between Annie and her daughter Margot provides an emotional anchor that grounds the story's more dramatic elements. Their interactions feel genuine and add depth to Annie's character beyond her professional struggles.\n\nWriting Style\n\nThe prose is sharp and cinematographic, befitting a story about visual storytelling. Segura alternates between present-day narrative and flashbacks with skill, maintaining momentum while gradually revealing crucial background information. The integration of comic book pages and industry documents adds authenticity to the world-building.\n\nCritical Analysis\n\nWhile Alter Ego is engaging throughout, there are aspects that could be stronger:\n\n1. The pacing occasionally slows in the middle sections as Annie investigates the Lynx's history\n2. Some secondary characters feel underdeveloped compared to the rich characterization of Annie and Carmen\n3. The corporate conspiracy elements sometimes stretch credibility\n4. The resolution, while satisfying emotionally, might feel too neat for some readers\n\nThematic Depth\n\nThe novel explores several compelling themes:\n\n- The tension between art and commerce in creative industries\n- Generational trauma and its impact on creativity\n- The struggle for recognition and ownership in male-dominated fields\n- The price of pursuing one's passion\n- Mother-daughter relationships and inherited legacies\n\nSeries Context\n\nAlter Ego works both as a standalone novel and as a companion to Secret Identity. While the first book focused on Carmen Valdez's creation of the Lynx character in the 1970s, this sequel examines the long-term consequences of those events through a modern lens. The books complement each other thematically while maintaining distinct identities.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nAlter Ego is an ambitious and largely successful blend of mystery, industry critique, and character study. While it occasionally stumbles under the weight of its complex plot, the emotional core of the story and its examination of creative ownership in the modern age make it a worthy read. The book offers enough depth and insight to satisfy both mystery fans and comics enthusiasts, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessor.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "You don’t have to be a fan of comic books to enjoy this book, it it helps.\n\nAnne Bustamante has been laying low since her last project was shelved, the mighty have fallen quickly after being Oscar nominated. She and her daughter are enjoying a quiet life when she gets the chance to come back and direct a movie about her favorite superhero, the Lynx. A heroine with a Cuban woman co-creator, she has always been close to this story. And the defunct triumph comics apparently still owns the IP.\n\nI always think it’s weird, character ownership and dispute and selling IP. This book is about the movie industry; with a little comic lore and murder mystery thrown in. The ultimate bad guy reveal was a bit of a letdown; there is really only one person it could ever have been. I really loved the villain Mindbender, who makes you believe things that aren’t true. What a throw back name. He’s like a gaslighter.\n\nThis book is no stretch for any woman who has ever had a man take credit for her ideas.\n\nThanks to @netgalley and @flatironbooks for the ARC.

        "Review 8": "To be published by Flatiron Books in December, 2024\n\nAlex Segura has found a brilliant way around the problem of sequels. ALTER EGO takes place a generation after the events of his comics-based thriller SECRET IDENTITY. Annie Bustamante is a comics artist, a filmmaker, a mother, and a woman with a turbulent past. Her dream is to work on a revived version of The Legendary Lynx, the comic created by Carmen Valdez in the first novel. Segura even manages to give shout outs to other characters in his oeuvre— investigator Peter Fernandez from his Miami series and The Dusk, the subject of his forthcoming comic series. You don’t need to be a comics nerd to enjoy this fast-paced thriller, but it helps. Names, real and imagined are dropped. Mostly, ALTER EGO is a story about mothers and daughters, about missing fathers, and about the intense world of intellectual property. The novel is illustrated with some sample pages from a Lynx comic, which were unavailable in the NetGalley version.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "First, I got an ARC of this in exchange for my honest opinion and I did so without knowing this was a sequel. That being said, it read like a stand alone to me and I don't feel I missed much of anything. There is some mention of the first book's title and I assume those are elements that tie the two together but my reading experience didn't suffer because I hadn't read the first.\n\nI think the premise is interesting and I liked seeing more about comics and how they do or do not work. The aspects that had to do with the physical composition of comics were some of my favorite stuff.\n\nThat being said, this is slow and not terribly thrilling. There's a mystery, kinda, but things don't really come to a head until about 96% of the way through the book. There's a small pop of action near the end.\n\nMy biggest struggle was with the idea that The Lynx is so obscure that Annie may be its only fan, but also so important that people are willing to kill over it. The idea doesn't seem to jive. Why are people banking on a comic no one knows anything about?\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "Thank you to Flatiron Books and Macmillan Audio for the #gifted copies to review.\n\nThis was quite a different read for me, but once it got started, I found I could not stop, and the audio was great, complete with sound effects on some of the chapters which worked so well. I liked the comic tie in, and the cat and mouse chase combined with the Hollywood setting. The pacing was fast and steady all the way through, and I liked the short chapters. I did not realize this was the second book in a series but it read just fine as a standalone. Very entertaining, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this book.\nShow more"

        "Review 2": "This is the second in what is being called the Claudia Lin series, the first being the very successful The Verifiers which I read and enjoyed.\n\nPicking up where the first book left off, Claudia is co partner with two others in Veracity which, while maintaining a low, secretive profile, provides a service that investigates if those who post in online dating sites are truthful in their interactions with potential partners. When they uncover a possible AI plot by one of the sites which may also involve murder, they work to untangle a web of deceit.\n\nSimilar to The Verifiers, this is a very contemporary story that is so much more than just a mystery. There are family relationships, cultural stereotypes, information about the internet dating industry and the negatives encountered in our online, AI influenced world, as well as a homage to classic mystery and espionage stories. I did think that it wandered around a bit in the middle but redeemed itself in the end. Those more in the know about all things tech than I am may not feel so lost.\n\nThanks to #NetGalley and @AAKnopf @VintageAnchorBooks for the DRC.\n\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "The second book in this series picks up with Claudia Lin continuing her work at Veracity, a unique organization that investigates the truthfulness of individuals using matchmaking services. This time, the plot thickens as Veracity uncovers a disturbing trend: matchmaking companies are creating “synths” — highly sophisticated fake profiles that behave almost like bots, manipulating real users and influencing opinions.\n\nThe premise is undeniably timely and intriguing, but the execution feels overly intricate. The story is weighed down by dense technical explanations, an array of code names, subplots involving other characters, and speculative scenarios. There’s a lot happening here. Claudia, for instance, crosses professional boundaries by meeting a client’s girlfriend, Amalia, and starts to develop feelings for her. At the same time, she grows increasingly concerned about her brother Charles and his suspicious involvement with the matchmaking companies. Adding to the complexity, Veracity recruits an insider from the matchmaking industry to feed them information.\n\nWhen the story focuses on action and relationships, it shines. Claudia’s personal connections—especially with her siblings, Charles and Coraline—are engaging and ripe for deeper exploration. Her queerness adds another layer of relatability, as she grapples with lingering feelings for her quasi-boss, Becks, while being drawn to Amalia. Unfortunately, the romantic tension is drawn out without much resolution, which can feel unsatisfying.\n\nThe book captures the unsettling power of fake online identities and their real-world consequences. While I could follow the plot well enough, the unresolved threads are frustrating. By the end, nothing significant is tied up—not the mystery of the matchmakers or the synths, nor the personal conflicts with Claudia’s siblings. It feels less like a complete story and more like a prelude to the next installment.\n\nClaudia herself remains a standout—a wonderfully queer, quirky protagonist. This series offers a unique premise but caters to readers who enjoy layered, cerebral mysteries and don’t mind a lack of immediate payoff.\n\nI received a copy of this book from Netgalley and Vintage Books in return for an unbiased review.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "In The Rivals, Jane Pek's eagerly anticipated sequel to The Verifiers, we return to the world of Claudia Lin – mystery novel enthusiast, cycling devotee, and now co-owner of Veracity, a dating detective agency in New York City. While the first book introduced us to Claudia's adventures in uncovering lies in the world of online dating, this follow-up raises the stakes significantly, diving deeper into the dark possibilities of artificial intelligence in matchmaking and the nature of human connection in our increasingly digital world.\n\nThe Plot Unravels\n\nThe story picks up with Claudia and her colleagues – the enigmatic Becks and the tech-savvy Squirrel – running Veracity after their mentor Komla's departure. Their mission has evolved from simply verifying online daters' claims to investigating a disturbing discovery: matchmaking companies are developing sophisticated AI profiles called \"synths\" that can pass as human users.\n\nWhen a client named Pradeep Mehta approaches them about a mysterious duplicate profile of himself, the investigation leads Claudia to Matthew Espersen, an insider at the dating platform Let's Meet. As she delves deeper into the world of digital twins and corporate espionage, Claudia must navigate personal complications, including growing feelings for both her colleague Becks and a charming target named Amalia Suarez.\n\nWriting Style and Narrative Structure\n\nPek's writing shines brightest in her ability to weave complex technological concepts into a compelling narrative without overwhelming the reader. The author masterfully balances multiple storylines:\n\n- The investigation into Let's Meet's digital twin program\n- Claudia's family dynamics, particularly with her siblings Charles and Coraline\n- The romantic tension between various characters\n- The larger implications of AI in modern relationships\n\nStrengths\n\nThe Rivals excels in several areas:\n\n1. Tech Commentary: Pek offers thought-provoking insights into how technology shapes our relationships and sense of self, without becoming preachy or dystopian.\n\n2. Character Development: Claudia's growth from the first book is evident, yet she remains endearingly flawed. Her struggle with honesty – both in her professional and personal life – creates compelling internal conflict.\n\n3. Cultural Representation: The book thoughtfully explores Asian American family dynamics and queer identity without making either the sole focus of the narrative.\n\n4. Mystery Elements: The plot is intricately crafted, with well-placed clues and satisfying revelations that reward attentive readers.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nWhile largely successful, the novel has a few minor shortcomings:\n\n- The technical aspects of the AI storyline occasionally become complex enough to potentially lose readers less familiar with technology\n- Some subplots, particularly involving secondary characters, could have been more fully developed\n- The pacing in the middle section sometimes slows as various plot threads are developed\n\nThematic Depth\n\nThe novel explores several compelling themes:\n\n- The tension between privacy and convenience in the digital age\n- The nature of truth and authenticity in online interactions\n- Family obligations versus personal authenticity\n- The role of technology in modern romance\n- The ethics of surveillance and data collection\n\nSeries Progression\n\nAs the second book in the Claudia Lin series, The Rivals builds effectively on the foundation laid in The Verifiers. While the first book introduced us to Claudia's world and the basic premise of dating verification, this sequel expands the scope significantly, raising both personal and societal stakes. The evolution feels natural and earned, avoiding the common pitfall of sequel escalation feeling forced.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nThe Rivals is a worthy successor to The Verifiers, successfully expanding both its world and themes while maintaining the elements that made the first book engaging. Jane Pek has crafted a sophisticated thriller that works both as entertainment and as commentary on our increasingly digitized lives.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Update! It’s here and I read it! I enjoyed this one a lot too. Bits were a little too tech-y for me and I’m not sure I understood it as well as I could’ve, but this is my new favorite series. I am mostly a lit-fic and non-fic reader, but I sprinkle in genre fiction here and there… mostly romance or sci-fi… but this is an exception for me. I adore Claudia and I have so much FUN reading these books.\n\nEagerly awaiting this one. I read the Verifiers and I absolutely loved it.

        "Review 6": "Rounding up to a 5. A very good modern murder mystery. I enjoy how the main character is always thinking about her life in terms of murder mysteries and spy novels. Another warning for a mean mom, but she doesn't feature as much as she did in the first book. I'm worried about Claudia and her siblings!\n",
        "Review 7": "Thank you to Vintage and Penguin Random House International for the free e-ARC in exchange for an honest review. #PRHInternationalPartner\n\n2024’s most unexpectedly delightful reading discovery for me is arguably Jane Pek’s Claudia Lin mystery series. It seems odd to sell it as Veronica Mars meets Weike Wang meets The Soulmate Equation… but that’s what it reminds me of. Very smart and satisfying, but still ultimately escapist, great for when I need a break from my heavier reads.\n\nTHE RIVALS picks up where the first book, The Verifiers, left off. A few months after Claudia becomes joint owner of Veracity, another one of their potential clients (whom they turned down) dies under mysterious circumstances. Convinced that the man died because he had stumbled across a company secret in the matchmaking industry, Claudia investigates a people who were close to the dead man, as well as does a deeper dive into the troubling (mis)use of fake profiles and Big Data in the matchmaking apps with the potential to disrupt the world. Along the way, she continues to grapple with her difficult Asian immigrant family and her own conflicted feelings towards a few mesmerizing women in her life.\n\nClaudia is simultaneously smart and relatable. She’s obsessive about her interest in detective work, but her eagerness sometimes wins out over her common sense, with amusing results. At the same time, I really related to her avoidant approach to dealing with her family and her love life.\n\nThe Claudia Lin series is not just an episodic procedural mystery, with open-and-shut cases in each book. Instead, there’s a buildup to something bigger and more sinister, a sense that there is a darker evil in the matchmaking tech industry that has not yet been revealed. THE RIVALS ends with an intriguing set-up and the potential for more and bigger mysteries in future books.\n\nA few things knocked this off from being a 5-star read for me. The first is that, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the disparate strands of Claudia’s story sometimes don’t mesh well together. In particular, the chapters about Claudia’s family drama seem shoehorned in, and don’t often have much to do to move the mystery forward. I still appreciated them because I found that they were relatable depictions of Asian immigrant family dynamics, but also recognize that more could be done with them. The second is that some aspects of the mystery do go over my head a bit. Some of the explanations lean far into the tech and startup world and weren’t as successfully translated over into plain English for us laypeople.\n\nDespite that, I remain very, very curious about how this series will progress, and I look forward to reading more about Claudia Lin from Jane Pek!\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "Claudia Lin returns in this sequel to The Verifiers, now one of the co-runners of sleuthing agency Veracity and finding out more about the hi-tech corporate shenanigans that have already resulted in a trail of bodies—will there be more deaths? And will Claudia's family keep throwing new complications in her path? The answer to these questions are of course yes, and yes.\n\nI really enjoyed spending more time with Claudia, who continues to be a low-key charming and believable lead character. Sometimes detective-esque characters are too quick to make connections in a way they would only do if they know they're in a crime novel; sometimes they're too slow, in a way that feels frustrating and like wheel-spinning. In general, Jane Pek gets Claudia's level of figuring things out Goldilocks-right: she's smart and intuitive but it's not over the top. Equally, the supporting characters are strong, and I'm really digging the building tension between Claudia and Becks.\n\nThere were a couple of points in the middle of the book where I did wonder why none of these smart characters seemed to be articulating one very big possibility about where the tech shenanigans were going—though that does happen nearer the end—and it does take it a little bit for Pek to get all the characters into place, so to speak. But once that does happen, she builds some real tension about what all of these events mean for Claudia and her family. Really looking forward to seeing how all of this plays out in the next book in the series.\n\n4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.\nShow more",

Basically, this series is about a woman, Claudia, who gets mixed up with an agency that investigates dating apps and the - in this universe - murderous, nefarious powers behind them. It's hard to write a book whose essential twists and turns hinge on what people do on their various internet devices, but I think Pek does her damndest, thought admittedly I got lost in the technological bits a few times. But they were easy enough to blow past.\n\nThis series has a fresh, unique voice, and several delightful recurring characters. It perfectly threads the needle between serious and fun.

Sitting here blown away by another complex story you have masterfully written!\n\nBen Koenig can’t feel fear. With a man like that, how could he NOT save the world? If you enjoy Lee Child books, CIA terrorism plot lines, people seeking revenge for something dark rooted…. this is one for you. Trust me.\n\nWhen I started this, I had to read at a slower pace due to all the information fed. You have to really pay attention to catch what’s going on. I have absolutely NO IDEA how Craven keeps up with this intricate story….. but he does a marvelous job!\n\nI still love the Poe & Tilly series more and can’t wait for the next installment. However, I’m definitely warming up to Ben Koenig! I will definitely read the next in the series with that magnificent final twist! I Fantastic humor written in. Lots of crazy action. Definitely recommend! Although, probably catering to all you tough guys out there 😎😵😈\n\nI’d like to thank Flatiron Books, NetGalley, and M.W Craven for the opportunity! All opinions are my own!

        "Review 2": "Ben Koenig is back, and the world hasn’t been this dangerous, or this entertaining, in a long time!\n\nIf you’ve been eagerly awaiting Ben Koenig’s return (and if you read Fearless--you should have been), Nobody’s Hero by M. W. Craven does not disappoint. This high-octane thriller picks up where Fearless left off, plunging Koenig—a man who can’t feel fear—back into a world of danger, mystery, and chaos. And, as expected, it’s a thrilling ride from start to finish.\n\nThe story begins with the murder of two pickpockets in London, which sets off a global chain of events. A cryptic message hidden in a reopened safe leads Koenig to a list of names, including his own. As he unravels the meaning behind “The Acacia Avenue Protocol,” he’s pulled into a complex web, where the stakes couldn't be higher. The plot is intricate, weaving together suspense and action, with twists that keep you guessing until the very last page.\n\nOne of the things I love about Koenig is his snarky attitude. He’s got a knack for delivering sharp one-liners, which inject much-needed humor into a story that’s filled with suspense, action, violence, and tension. But it’s not all about the quips—Koenig’s emotional depth, tangled with his chaotic personal life, makes him an endlessly fascinating character.\n\nThis book is fast-paced, packed with action, and has its share of graphic violence, but it’s all in service of the plot. From northern England to the remote Scottish airfields, and across to New York and Nevada, Koenig faces off against corrupt cops, a terrifying private military contractor, and a killer with a bizarre fear of yellow. The unpredictability of it all makes for a ride that’s as thrilling as it is relentless.\n\nWhat I really appreciate, though, is how Craven masterfully balances the adrenaline rush with a complex storyline that makes you think. It's one of those books that requires you to pay attention because there’s a lot going on. The chapters are short (which is always a plus for me), making it a book you can’t help but devour quickly.\n\nIf you’re opting for the audiobook, William Hope does an excellent job narrating this thrill-ride. His voice brings Koenig to life, perfectly capturing the character’s snark and emotional complexity. Hope’s ability to convey tension and emotion heightens the listening experience, making every high-stakes moment feel urgent and real. While his portrayal of female voices is decent, it’s his performance of Koenig that truly steals the show, adding an extra layer of intensity to this already gripping story.\n\nIn short, Nobody’s Hero is a great follow-up to Fearless, delivering exactly what you want in a thriller—action, suspense, and a protagonist who just won’t quit. If you like your thrillers fast, smart, and a little bit chaotic, this is the book for you.\n\nThanks to Macmillan Audio for providing an advance reader’s copy for review.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "First and foremost, a large thank you to NetGalley, M.W. Craven, and Macmillan Audio for providing me with a copy of this publication, which allows me to provide you with an unbiased review.\n\nI have long enjoyed the work of M.W. Craven, who has never failed to impress. This newer series has me curious, as Ben Koenig reminds me of Jack Reacher, but with a different flavouring. Craven has been able to craft his protagonist well and keeps the reader wondering. After the murder of two pickpockets in the heart of London, a secret list demands that Ben Koenig be notified and brought into the investigation. While Koenig is former US Military, his current nomadic lifestyle has many wondering if this is a typo. However, Koenig provides some context and is sent to London to look into the murders, as well as a larger investigation into a group of killers. Craven does well to add depth to this series, which still has a great deal to offer.\n\nThe murder of two London pickpockets sets off a chain of events with global repercussions. While the investigation appears to be going nowhere, a list actioning a mysterious protocol includes one odd addition, former US Military officer Ben Koenig. This will take some time and effort, but when Ben Koenig is located, his presence on the list baffles everyone, particularly because he is such a nomad and has no firm ties to the US Military or Intelligence spheres.\n\nWhile Koenig is unsure why he is asked to help, but he does recognize the killer, someone he killed a decade ago. Still, he’s up for a mystery and agrees to head to London to get some answers. While there, he discovers that there is more to the story than simply a series of murders. Koenig remains on the outside why and how his name found its way onto the list, but he is determined to get answers. Traipsing across the world and following any lead presented to him, Ben Koenig wants to know what’s going on, no matter how many bodies he leaves in his wake. A chilling story that never leaves the reader a chance to catch their breath, in true M.W. Craven style.\n\nThere is never a lack of action when M.W. Craven has a story idea. His work is always so busy and keeps the reader wondering what awaits them. The narrative style of this story works well and keeps the reader guessing as they learn a little more about Ben Koenig. Building momentum, the story soon finds its climax and stays intense for the remainder. Koenig is a great protagonist and is surrounded by strong characters, all of whom flavour the book in their own ways. The plot gets thicker and keeps things moving, using short chapters to add to the surprise. Who is Ben Koenig and how will he add to the series? This and many other questions await the dedicated reader whose curiosity is not easily sated.\n\nKudos, Mr. Craven, for another great addition to this series.\n\nLove/hate the review?

        "Review 4": "Nobody's Hero is an action thriller par excellence! Just strap yourself in and enjoy the ride. I don't know how I missed M.W. Craven in the past, but count me as a fan. Jack Reacher has nothing on Ben Koenig.\nI loved the kick ass women characters, and with all of the twists and turns, I guarantee you'll never see what's coming next. It's a thrill tide until the last page.\nHighly recommend.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Loved Book 1, Double Loved Book 2\n\nBen is back and what a character he is, the ‘agent’ who literally, biologically does not feel fear is tasked with finding out….well lets put this in basic terms…..something that could cause a mass event and the people that know about it and the people that are going to trigger it….and it all starts in Speakers Corner with a seemingly unprovoked double murder\n\nI love the characters, good, bad, fair to middling, love the dry acerbic quick wit….the action…the conversations….the settings…the drama…and of course this is all because the writing and the story is so so good\n\nI also enjoy the information given on many subjects, not long and boring but enough to pique your interest and gain a bit of knowledge, sometimes on the rarest of subjects\n\nI can’t tell you how much I enjoyed this book other than to say I REALLY enjoyed every page, every sentence and everything about it...\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "My Rating: 4⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ this is a me 4 star and not an everyone 4 star… you are warned!!!\n\nThis is the second book in a series that from what I understand was never meant to see the light of day. Go into these books with the expectation that its Die Hard on steroids. M.W. Craven wrote the first book for himself during Covid and was never going to publish until his publisher said gimme gimme!!\n\nThey are meant to be wild and over the top and mega action packed… they are get your disbelief ball it up set it alight and throw it over a cliff kind of far fetched… and that is on purpose… so if you don’t like that then I suggest never ever ever reading these…\n\nWith that said… I love me some Die Hard and I was all for it. I gave the first book 4 stars and to be honest I liked it more than this one… but not much so while I was trying to decide what rating to give it I threw caution to the wind and went with 4. This story is wild as stated above… and Ben Koenig can do it all.. he can cut someone’s head open until their face flops forward with a credit card… its that kind of wild… which I am here for… as stated.\n\nIt got even a little bit too mental at the end for me… and I was like really… come on… but then I remembered my own disclaimer and just went with it.\n\nI love M.W. Craven’s writing and the Washington Poe series is some of my fave fiction ever… so while I impatiently wait for more of that I read this… and I like this but its just not nearly as good. The writing it always on point though and that is what keeps the rating high… he is engaging and entertaining and you can’t ask for more than that when this is supposed to be a yahoo mental ride.\n\nOverall, the only people who will like this are people who love watching Bruce Willis throw a car at a helicopter and will rewind it to watch it again and be screaming yippe-kay-ay mother f*cker with him… so bear that in mind!!!\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Book Review\nNobody’s Hero\nM. W. Craven\nreviewed by Lou Jacobs\n\n\nreadersremains.com | Goodreads\n\n\nMulti-award-winning British crime novelist M.W. Craven returns with his second high-octane action thriller featuring Ben Koenig—”the man with no fear.” A former U.S. Marshal and now an intelligence operative, Koenig is recruited by the CIA to thwart an international plot that threatens the stability of America and the world.\n\n\n\nBen has a rare genetic disorder affecting his brain, which removes all caution when faced with mortal danger. At times, this condition has proved both a curse and a valuable asset in his line of work. He has no problem with killing people when necessary. In this adventure, Ben faces four armed and ruthless opponents, dispatching them easily with his specially devised “sharpened” credit card—without even needing to utilize his unique Fairbairn-Sykes dagger.\n\nThe action begins with a brutal double murder and an abduction in the streets of London. Surveillance footage captures the image of the perpetrator—a woman well known to Ben. A decade earlier, clandestine services had asked Ben to fake her death and facilitate her disappearance. Her resurfacing now presents an impending disaster for global security.\n\nBen teams up with intelligence operative Jen Draper, who despises him due to past misadventures. Their mutual razor-sharp banter provides frequent comic relief amid the escalating violence and intrigue.\n\nThis novel will appeal to fans of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher and Gregg Hurwitz’s Orphan X series. A continuous stream of cinematic action sequences is interspersed with Ben’s sardonic and sarcastic wit, reminiscent of Nelson DeMille’s John Corey character. Over the course of this adrenaline-laced outing, Ben contends with a father-daughter hit team, the Russian crime syndicate, merciless military contractors, and international terrorists.\n\nM.W. Craven masterfully weaves together a complex, intricate plot filled with red herrings and unexpected twists. Supported by amazing characters, intense action, and unrelenting violence, the story builds to an explosive denouement. Craven expertly provides the necessary backstory, ensuring this book stands on its own. However, after reading this gripping tale, readers will be compelled to download Fearless—the first Ben Koenig novel. This relentlessly paced book is easily devoured in just a few sittings.\n\nI personally alternated between reading on Kindle and listening to William Hope’s narration of the audiobook. Hope expertly modulates his tone and affect to bring each character vividly to life in the theatre of the mind.\n\nThanks to NetGalley, Flatiron Books, and Macmillan Audio for providing an uncorrected proof and advance audio version in exchange for an honest review. I eagerly await Ben Koenig’s next misadventure!\n.... Published at MysteryAndSuspenseMagazine.com....\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "Wow Wow Wow!\n\nLet me start by saying that I won this book as a giveaway on Goodreads. I was over the moon because I LOVE M.W. Craven's Washington Poe series! (Haven't read it? Get on it!!). Anyway, I realized after winning this, it was the second installment in the Ben Koenig series. So I hurried up and purchased Fearless and read it. Great read!\n\nAnyway, Koenig was head of the US Marshall's Special Operations Group but now he's on the run from the Russians and has a 5 million dollar bounty on his head. Koenig is highly intelligent, a lateral thinker and lethal! What makes him extremely unique is a condition called Urbach-Weithe disease. He literally cannot feel fear. As a result, Koenig takes chances that most sane people wouldn't.\n\nWhen a murder and abduction happens in London, a special vault in the US is open and the Acacia Avenue Protocol is set in motion. Koenig is the final name on the list and he's the only member still alive. He's tasked with finding the mysterious woman who kidnapped another woman in broad daylight so it can be understood why America is under attack and what method the terrorists plan on using to take the country out.\n\nThis book is a PAGE TURNER!!! The plot is full of action and moves swiftly. The characterization is great. Koenig is clever and witty but also a lethal killer. His handler (Jen Draper) is great too. She's savvy, smart and edgy. To add to the fun, Draper and Koenig have a hate/hate (or is it actually a love/hate ?) relationship. Draper drops some great one-liners when she's talking about Koenig.\n\nSince Koenig isn't afraid of anything, the author has a great deal of creative freedom to write crazy scenarios and action scenes. They are tense and exciting (but also violent and bloody).\n\nBUT THE FINAL PAGES IN THIS BOOK BLEW ME AWAY! There was a twist (and maybe I should have seen it coming but I didn't) that literally had me gasp out loud. (Yippie Ki Yay 😂 and then even more!). I cannot wait for the next book in this series.\n\nBe warned - the Poe series is very different from the Koenig series. This one is more thriller and edge of your seat action with a fair amount of violence and graphic scenes. Even so, it is so good.\n\nI highly recommend this book. M.W. Craven is one of my favorite authors and doesn't disappoint in Nobody's Hero!\n\nThanks to Goodreads and Flatiron books for an advanced readers copy of this book to read and review!\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Ben Koenig is becoming one of my new favorite characters. Theis series is so darn good I need to read some of the authors other stuff. Nobody's Hero by M.V. Craven is the second book about Koenig, the man who knows no fear. It is a great concept and the story and characters in this book are great. I must say that I really had some fun reading this one and I can strongly recommend this series for fans of well written thrillers. I must thank Edelweiss , Macmillan and Flatiron Books for letting me read this advance copy of a great book.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "The man who fears nothing , Ben Koenig is back in Nobody’s Hero!! When the stakes are this high, Ben is your man. How can you not love a man who is scared of nothing, a human fighting machine, with a brain to boot. Oh and he is funny, so funny!! For an action read, there is so much humour which I just loved so much.\n\nI am a big fan of this authors Tilly and Poe series, another dark and disturbing series. If you love those books you need to meet Ben. He is called to action after a double murder and abduction in Hyde Park in London. His name is on a list and he has no idea why. Along with his handler, Jen Draper, they need to stop this and save the world, all the while, avoiding being taken in for the 5 million dollar bounty the Russians have out on him.\n\nAs you would expect, this book is action packed from start to finish. It is violent, no holds barred. I was there for it all, an adrenaline rush for thriller lovers. I was in the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. So many wild twists, it was just amazing.\n\nThanks so much to Flatiron for my advanced copy of this book to read. Publishes in the US Dec 3rd, and Australia in October.\nShow more"

Lilah and Kane and their craziness and dances with danger has kept me wide-eyed, on the edge of my seat throughout this series.\n\nThese books are not standalones because each book builds upon the events of the previous ones including the relationship dynamics and all the drama and danger and check mate moves carried out.\nAll the books continue in a duet style though meaning, Lilah is seen solving a new case in each duet with the story continuing forward but with a new mystery to solve.\n\nThis one continues right from where we left off in the previous book where we see Lilah facing off the deadliest assassin, Ghost.\n\nI don't understand how I've not highlighted this one thing, BUT THE FREAKING BANTER IN THESE BOOKS ARE LIT.

Then her team of techs- Tic-Tac, Lucas (step-cousin) & now reluctantly, Jack, is something I really look forward to even when they are freaking racing against time to piece together all info that they have on a case.\n\nKane is finally seeming to get back his control as he changes strategy and does what Kane does best - outsmart his enemies and always have the upper hand.\n\nThis time though, Lilah is being ordered by the biggest players and hence she has to be more careful as the case involves not only her boss but the higher ups, whose lives might still be in grave danger.\n\nI WAS HERE FOR THE FACE OFF between Lilah and Ghost. One second they are friends and the other, I was sceptical one of them would off the other one.\nThey were like literally someone being on a seesaw with the deadly dance they were doing around each other.\n\nOohhh... That ending... Do we have Junior back again... Can't wait to find out. Ahh.. less than a year now for the next book but I know, will be so worth the wait. Excited for the next one.

        "Review 3": "AGENT VS ASSASSIN is the tenth instalment in LR Jones aka Lisa Renee Jones’s contemporary, adult LILAH LOVE romantic, suspense series focusing on foul-mouthed, aggressive, contentious and prickly FBI agent Lilah Love-Mendez, and her husband, businessman /Cartel heir Kane Mendez. AGENT VS ASSASSIN should not be read as a stand alone as it picks up after the events of book nine THE GHOST ASSASSIN. If you have not read the previous instalments, there may be spoilers in my review.\n\nNOTE: Due to the nature of the story line premise, there may be triggers for more sensitive readers.\n\nSOME BACKGROUND: Throughout the series, Lilah Love has been looking into an organization known as The Society, a powerful group that controls many of the politicians, law enforcement personnel, and the rich and famous, and it is this group that may or may not be targeting the people at the top, one of which is her estranged father, a man running for Governor, a man with connections to the people in control.\n\nTold from first person perspective (Lilah) AGENT VS ASSASSIN picks up shortly after the events of THE GHOST ASSASSIN. Lilah has been struggling with the memories from her past, yet the assassin known as Ghost has offered to take down the ghosts that continue to haunt her dreams but there is more than one assassin on the horizon, and Lilah may be the target of both. With her father running for governor, and her brother working alongside, Lilah begins to focus on the who, how and why, as another high profile murder grabs the attention of FBI agent Lilah Love-Mendez.\n\nThe world building continues to follow Lilah as she battles the incompetent yet determined law enforcement, and her team of rag tag specialists with the ability to uncover other people’s secrets and lies. As Kane must come to terms with the reappearance of a man long thought dead, Lilah will come face to face an interesting foe.\n\n\nThere is another large ensemble of secondary and supporting characters including Lilah’s bodyguard Jay, Kane’s bodyguard Kit; Lilah’s brother Andrew; hacker Lucas Davenport; and Lilah’s IT guru Jeff ‘TicTac’ Landers, most of whom are the hunter/gatherers of Lilah’s investigations. We are introduced to an assassin who goes by Ghost, who is always one step ahead of our story line heroine; and the return of someone long thought buried and gone, a return that barely merits a few paragraphs of text.\n\nAGENT VS ASSASSIN is a story of power and control, betrayal and obsession, dysfunctional family dynamics, relationships and love. The premise is detailed and dramatic yet barely advances the story line but a couple of days; the characters are charismatic yet guarded. AGENT VS ASSASSIN ends on a cliff hanger, you have been warned.\n\n\ncopy supplied for review\nShow more",

I love Lilah Love, FBI agent with a stripper name and Kane Mendez, her oil tycoon/cartel kingpin boyfriend…or is he? Their chemistry is off the charts. They balance each other in unimaginable ways.\n\nLilah comes from Hamptons royalty with a movie star mother, who died in an airplane crash and a mayor father. She dropped out of law school when her mother died and opted to become an FBI agent/profiler.

I’m not sure I can commit to any more books in the series given that the books are published every 12-18 months and the next book won’t be published for another 10 months. We’ll see.

This is not a romantic suspense in the traditional sense. The focus is more on Lilah’s life as a fiercely independent FBI profiler with the romance factor sprinkled in.\nAgent Vs. Assassin is the tenth book in the series and is the continuation of The Ghost Assassin. It is not necessary to read the series from the beginning but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do since the main and multiple supporting characters are mentioned throughout the entire series.\n\nShow more"

It was excessively wordy with lots of punctuation. The characters didn’t feel like real people either. This book seems highly rated though so it could very well just be a me thing.

        "Review 1": "If you enjoy medical thrillers with a supernatural twist, then look no further than Bellevue by Robin Cook. It’s a little different from other books I’ve read by this author, but it was another great thriller filled with suspense, horror, and visions related to historic medical practices.\n\nWhile the prologue starts with a chilling medical scene from 1949, most of the novel takes place in current times and features twenty-three-year-old Michael (Mitt) Fuller as he starts his surgical residency at the well-known Bellevue Hospital in New York City. He’s following in his ancestors’ steps. Three previous Fullers were surgeons and one was a psychiatrist at the famed hospital.\n\nHe is anxious, but excited to start his residency. One advantage is that he’s always had a secret sixth sense. However, when his patients start to die from various mysterious causes, he tries to understand what’s happening while experiencing the demands and lack of sleep of being a first-year resident. Along with this, Mitt begins to have visions and finds himself drawn to an abandoned Bellevue building.\nMitt is intelligent, has a precognitive ability that is not constant or controllable, and feels uncertain that medical school adequately prepared him for this job. He tends to be more cerebral than physical, and is feeling anxious and stressed.\n\nCook’s writing is vivid and enabled me to easily visualize Bellevue as well as the people and the medical procedures and operations. Dynamic characters and fantastic world-building, along with a great plot, intense scenes, and excellent pacing kept me glued to the book. It was also fascinating to see how different the various attending surgeons were in the operating room as well as the high expectations of a first-year surgical resident.\n\nReading Cook’s novels are always a learning experience. In this case, readers are shown current surgeries for a variety of problems, but also learn about historic medical practices and how those affected the public health.\n\nThe author’s writing style hooked me immediately. The prose is well-written and engaging, but the subject matter was sometimes close to horror. Readers can tell the author’s surgical experience and research served to make the surgery details feel realistic. The atmosphere is tense and serious throughout the novel and it has substantial technical details. My only quibble is with the ending. I was hoping for something different. However, I understand why it ended the way it did.\n\nOverall, this suspenseful, engaging, thought-provoking, and tragic medical thriller gripped me from the beginning. It was difficult to put down. I’m a fan of the author and am looking forward to reading his next novel.\n\nPENGUIN GROUP Putnam – G.P. Putnam’s Sons and Robin Cook provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. The publication date is currently set for December 03, 2024. This review was originally posted at Mystery and Suspense Magazine.\n---------------------------------------\nMy 4.19 rounded to 4 stars review is coming soon.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Very Monotone and singular read. For the medical nerds in the house; I'm one of them, you are going to love the intellectual angle of this. Still it just didn't hit the mark, and it had so much potential to do so. I wish we learned more about the other ancestors in the main character's story; only the surface was scratched.\n\nThanks to Penguin Group Putnam and NetGalley for this ARC! Beyond humbled\n\nSolid 2.5 STARS!!\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Thanks to NetGalley for this ARC. Unfortunately it was a dud. The story had promise, but fell flat.\n\nFirst, the jargon. Sure, I expect medical jargon in a Robin Cook novel. However, the HUGE amount of architectural jargon and what my dad would call \"50 cent words\" was unwarranted, out of place, and way over done. Yes, give us some nice description so we can grasp the majesty and creepiness of the building. But don't beat us over the head with it! Nobody reading a medical/supernatural thriller wants paragraph upon paragraph of architecture words that mean nothing to them and make their eyes glaze over in the middle of what should be a riveting scene.\n\nSecond, the characters. Twenty-somethings, whether they are doctors or not, do not talk like that. They do not say \"My word\" and \"Good gracious\". His characters talk like 70 year olds. Or maybe young adults from the 50's. I spend a lot of time with that age bracket and the author clearly needs to at least have a couple conversations with a modern twenty-something.\n\nThird, story. The story has so much great potential. Being a reader of both medical thrillers and supernatural ones I was excited for this combo from a well-respected author. The first half of the story is pretty good...giving you backstory, strange happens, and drawing you in. A little over halfway through the book it goes downhill. The main character, Mitt, starts making absolutely nonsensical choices and even his explained thinking process makes you say \"what?\". And then it abruptly ends. Not even in an good unexplained mystery type of way which is often done in supernatural books, but instead feels very abrupt and jarring like the author hit a word count and was like, okay here's the ending!\n\nAll in all, I don't recommend even if you are a fan of Robin Cook. I did receive this early reading copy in exchange for a review and as you can see, I do not shill 4-5 star reviews in hopes of getting more books. I give my honest opinion, whatever it is.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Someone give me back the wasted hours reading this book. As a surgeon with over 30 years under my belt I should be able to give an unbiased review.\nFor non-medicos, the book would be a PITA with so many detailed descriptions of operative procedures that do not contribute in any way to the story. For medicos it's like revising a operative manual. And with one death after the other, it's like the editor says, hey we need 40 more pages, just add one more death. And the less said about the end the better. Seems like the editor to blame again when he yelled back saying, hey we've had enough. Just end the damn book. So it ended. Couldn't have been more abrupt or meaningless.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "In his latest medical thriller, Bellevue, bestselling author Robin Cook takes readers on a chilling journey through the halls of New York's legendary Bellevue Hospital, weaving together medical drama, supernatural horror, and historical fiction. The novel marks Cook's return to form while venturing into new territory by incorporating elements of supernatural horror into his trademark medical suspense formula.\n\nThe Plot\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Michael \"Mitt\" Fuller begins his surgical residency at Bellevue Hospital with high hopes of following in the footsteps of his illustrious ancestors - four generations of Fuller doctors who helped shape the institution's rich history. However, his experience quickly turns nightmarish when his patients begin dying under mysterious circumstances. As Mitt struggles with the crushing demands of being a first-year resident, he's plagued by increasingly disturbing visions of a young blonde girl in a bloodstained dress and hordes of mutilated spirits from Bellevue's past.\n\nThe story takes a darker turn when Mitt discovers hidden patient records in the abandoned Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital building, revealing shocking truths about his ancestors' controversial medical practices. As he delves deeper into these historical records, the line between past and present begins to blur, leading to a terrifying climax that forever changes his life.\n\nWriting Style and Narrative\n\nCook's prose is crisp and clinical when describing medical procedures, yet becomes appropriately atmospheric during the supernatural sequences. The author skillfully balances technical medical terminology with accessible narrative, making complex procedures understandable without losing authenticity. The pacing is relentless, with tension building steadily as Mitt's situation becomes increasingly desperate.\n\nStrengths\n\n- Historical Integration: Cook masterfully weaves actual historical events and practices from Bellevue's 300-year history into the narrative, creating a rich backdrop that enhances the story's impact.\n\n- Character Development: Mitt Fuller's transformation from confident young doctor to haunted victim is convincingly portrayed, with his psychological deterioration feeling organic and believable.\n\n- Medical Authenticity: The author's medical background shines through in detailed descriptions of surgical procedures and hospital protocols.\n\n- Atmospheric Setting: The abandoned psychiatric hospital serves as a perfect gothic backdrop, with Cook bringing its creepy corridors and dark history vividly to life.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\n- The supernatural elements occasionally feel abrupt in what begins as a traditional medical thriller\n- Some secondary characters could have been more fully developed\n- The ending might feel too extreme for readers expecting a more conventional medical mystery\n- A few plot points rely heavily on coincidence\n\nThe Historical Element\n\nOne of the novel's greatest strengths is its exploration of medical history's darker chapters. Through Mitt's discoveries about his ancestors, Cook examines controversial practices like pre-anesthesia surgery, non-consensual experimentation, and lobotomies. The author doesn't shy away from depicting the brutal reality of 19th and early 20th-century medicine, making readers question the ethical implications of medical progress.\n\nThematic Depth\n\nCook explores several compelling themes throughout the novel:\n\n- The weight of familial legacy and expectations\n- The ethical evolution of medical practice\n- The psychological toll of medical training\n- The tension between scientific progress and human dignity\n- The haunting effects of institutional memory\n\nFinal Verdict\n\n\"Bellevue\" represents both a successful evolution of Cook's style and a compelling examination of medical history's darker aspects. While the supernatural elements might surprise longtime fans, they serve the story's themes effectively. The novel succeeds as both a medical thriller and a gothic horror tale, offering readers a unique blend of genres while maintaining Cook's trademark medical authenticity.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "Cook’s worst most unbelievable book.\n\nThe only words that kept my attention were the ones describing Bellevue’s architecture prior to the new building as well as the wonderful nurses, etc Perhaps the only reason I enjoyed the hospitals description is because it is accurately described as the way I experienced it as a student/graduate nurse in the 60’s. Especially the basement corridors which connected to all of the buildings. We likened the floor cobbling as resembling brain convolutions. I’ve even heard the ghost stories from the long employed aides ( who, by the way’ were reluctant to go into the base,ent where the morgue had been.\nThe story line is ludicrous, undeveloped and unbelievably poorly written. I’ve met new July residents but a graduate from Columbia admitted for a Bellevue residency in surgery is no dummy, nor would he be so gullible to follow ghosts unless he was suffering from schizophrenia which was never hinted at.\nI am so disappointed. If there was a synopsis of the book as written I would not have purchased it.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "This is my first Robin Cook in years, and while I always enjoyed the author's medical thrillers. this one has too much of a focus on the supernatural and the occult for me. Other loyal Cook fans, however, will surely love it.",
        "Review 8": "Wow! Unlike many other authors Robin Cook just gets better with age and doesn't rely on co-authors to trade on his name. This book was a stunner and tells the tale of \"Mitt\" Fuller a first year resident doctor and relays what could be interpreted as his decent into madness OR his being a person sensitive to the spirits of the deceased--you have to read the book to decide for yourself. But woven into that story is a ton of history about Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital in NYC.\n\nThis is a must read for Robin Cook fans. You don't need to have a medical background to grasp the story...it is all explained. However, you have to be able to deal with all the details that are involved in an intense dark medical thriller.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Sadly yet another disappointment book wise!",
        "Review 10": "I’ve read a couple books by Cook in the past and loved them, so I was super excited to read this one. Unfortunately, this wasn’t what I was hoping for. Chapter one was gruesome but interesting while also having innumerable details about things that had no bearing on the story. Once we reached present day, the foreshadowing was heavy handed. Mick’s “sixth sense” and his mind reading abilities (but only when they lock eyes) were described in great detail, only for Mick to feel the same sensations (that were described previously) multiple times before he thought all about them minutes later while talking with his friend. There was so much repetition throughout the story; thoughts were thought then discussed, events happened and then had to be recounted to multiple people in multiple different conversations. The dialogue felt stilted and unreal, like the characters were caricatures of people.\nWhile I love the concept, I feel like the author was trying too hard to sell the paranormal aspects of the story and didn’t spend enough attention on making the non-paranormal pieces work.\n\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "4.75!\n\n“All those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don't get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.\nThose are the moments that make a life.\nNot grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.\nThe things that matter.\nThe things I can't stop longing for.”\n\nNow I am not gonna lie but this was not Emily's best work and after a rant with Roxy I understand that there can be some things that could have been done to make the story better but that does not change the fact that I loved reading this book and did not want it to end because you just have to read Emily Henry's works to understand that! Good writing is such a plus for me because if the writing is engaging and has you fully immersed in the book you probably won't see the problems that it has, unless its pin pointed out and this was the case with this book because I was so in love with the writing and the characters and with everything that she set up that I did not even find anything bothering me. She writes such intricate characters who you can relate with so much and you actually do feel for them, overlapped with such realistic qualities and problems that makes you relate to them and that doesn't make you feel alone because you see how another character faces the same problems, deals with it the same way you do and there' just something so beautiful about it.\n\nOkay so it's basically about two two people Daphna and Miles both their Fiancées cheat on them which leads to Daphne getting kicked out of Peters house and has to stay with Miles and while they both are there, the get a wedding invitation from their exes which leads to Miles and Daphne falling into a fake relationship to make them jealous and honestly them being roommates as well was so hot. It was different from other fake dating tropes because of the way it was set but the way it unraveled could have been something more. There's this quote during this scene where Daphne tells Miles of what she did that I laughed at and smiled stupidly at:\n\n\"Wait!' He braces his hands against the counter, face brightening. \"So he called to try to make you feel so pathetic you wouldn't come ruin his special day and you told him we were dating?'\n\n'Im sorry,' I say again.\n\n'That fucking rules,' He says. 'How'd he take it?\"\n\nDaphne and Miles were such good characters and I kind of think that there could have been more depth to them but I still enjoyed the way that they were written in like Daphne self doubting herself because of her father always left her after promising that he was there to stay and I loved how she got over it and finally confessed her feeling by giving an angry rant on his phone because he needed that and I also appreciated the bond that she had with her mother although I do think that we could have gotten more one on one scenes for them and as for Miles, I loved him so much and its with all Emily Henry's men, I see myself in them.. be it Gus, Wyn, Charlie, Alex or Miles theres always something within them that I find I can relate too and for here with Miles was how he texts, the way he overuses the word nice which bug Roxy off so much but for me the thing that I related to him the most was where He panicked and reacted anxiously and then realized what he had done a little too late I won't elaborate on that because that would be a spoiler but I did get him during that scene but besides that scene, Miles was such a cute and hot too?? loved him. There was one thing that I appreciated as well but thought more could have been done was Miles past with her mother and how it turned him into who he was, always overlooking peoples negative side, never lashing out and always being nice(?)\n\nTheir banter that I loved:\n\"True,' he says 'but I haven't had any luck yet tracking down the stretch of beach where thirtysomethings go to smoke weed'\n'Oh, they're all just vaping from their beds while watching HGTV'\n'Not us,' he says\n'No, we're adventurous' I say\"\n_\n\"I turn to look at him. 'Even when you try to be mean, you're nice,'\nHis eyes seem to spark when he smiles. 'I'll try harder.\"\n_\n\"Do me a favor,' he says lightly, 'Unlock your door.'\n'Why?'\n'So I can push you out as I peel out of the parking lot,' he says,\n'You would never,' I say\n'I would never' he admits.\"\n_\n“Drink. Dance. Have fun.”\n“In a room with our exes,” I point out. “Who think we’re dating.”\nMiles’s smile hitches up. “See?” he says. “Doesn’t that sound fun?”\n\nI absolutely loved the friendship that Ashleigh and Daphne had because it was so down to earth and real and raw that I just fell in love with it and I think it was because Emily focused on Ashleighs character as well and gave her a story which made us understand where she was coming from and what was happening and how that eventually led them to be friends and I also loved how she supported Daphne's decisions but wont lie to her as well and would subtly try to make her understand things, she was certainly better than whatever the fuck Sadie was. Another bond that I liked but thought some scenes could have been explored more was of Miles and his sister JUlie they were just so wholesome and cute and deserve the whole world.\n\n\"You're worth it, Daphne,\" he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.\n'Miles?' I whisper. 'I do, I do what all those parts of you'\nHis eyes open, molten, warm, 'Good,' He says. 'They want you too.'\nThen he kisses me.\"\n\nThe romance was honestly the horniest Emily has ever been it was not I would say insta-lust because there was development and it wasn't like ' oh one look and im hard' but it was that instead of the intense pining, proximity and slow burn, they just acted on what they felt. I am a sucker for slow burn and wanted more but I cant deny how much I enjoyed reading the scenes. Also, the way emily henry also writes poetic smut?? Like??? How can you do that woman. Despite it being her horniest, it was very well balanced.\n\nNow,The things that could have been better; (spoilers)(credits;roxy)\n\n1, More drama as we were promised a wedding which could have increased the sexual tension, the fake dating part and the drama a lot.\n\n2, Daphne going to her mom to rant like we saw Rory do with Lorelai in Gilmore Girls.\n\n3, Male povs because having Miles's POV would have been so interesting since would've gotten his emotional scene with Julie and it wouldve been more showing and less telling.\n\n4, More drama by Miles's mother meeting them and this book being at least 200 pages more\n\nNow the scenes that I loved\n\n1, When Daphne gets dumped and throws almonds at Petra and Peter\n\n2, Miles and Daphne hanging out across the town\n\n3, The cherry hill scene with Ashleigh, Miles and Daphne\n\n4, Daphne making it up to Ashleigh\n\n5, Miles going to confront Daphne's dad\n\n6, The cute tender moments between Miles and Daphne that will make you feel single.\n\n7, the milkshake, fries and beach scene.\n\nOverall, a fantastic read that I will definitely read again and again despite some things that could have been added.\n\nRatings for her other books:\n1, Beach read: 5\n2, Happy place: 5\n3, Funny story: 4.75\n4, People we meet on vacation: 4.5\n5, Book lovers: 4.02\n\nSpecial shoutout to Roxy for getting me to read all of Emily's books last year and hearing my rants about it. We need another EH buddy reading session.\n___\nEMILY HENRY I AM IN LIVE WITH YOU!! LETS GET MARRIED SO I CAN GET ALL THE STORIES YOU WRITE (RTC when I finish my rant with Roxy and gather my thoughts)\n___\nIts time 💫\n\n• Buddy reading with the one and only Roxy\n\n(Emily Henry so far all my anticipated reads have not met my expectations I'm begging you pls don't disappoint.)\n___\nYes, Emily henry is a drug and i am an addict.\n\nI am not even joking when i say this but this is the only ting that i am looking forward to this year.\n\nEmily Henry writes the best books, her writing style alone is so beautiful and bewitching and the feeling of loosing yourself to it is so immense and amazing that i just cant wait to feel that again!!\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "2.5/5\n\nThe review contains spoilers!\n\nWhat a forgettable, bland, boring and not Funny Story. This is my first Emily Henry book that turned out being such a letdown for me, as I was a big fan of the rest of her stories, or at least most of them. I'm still not entirely sure if the title was meant to refer to the way our two main characters, Miles and Daphne, began their relationship — \"You know, Funny Story.. my fiancé dumped me for his childhood best friend, who happened to be Miles’s girlfriend, and that’s how we ended up living together, and then I accidentally told my ex-fiancé that Miles and I are dating, so now we are fake dating.\", or if it was just meant to suggest that this would be a fun story to read. Maybe it even refers to both of these options at the same time — which is most likely, but unfortunately, as I already said, it didn't end up to be a fun read for me.\n\n\nAs usual, as in every Emily Henry book, we have a book-loving character, this time a librarian — Daphne, who turned out to be quite an okay heroine for me. I could relate to her in a few ways and if I had to choose which main character I liked more, I would point at her, but at the same time, she wasn't even close to the bond I had with January, who I'm starting to think will always be my favorite heroine of this author. I probably would have felt more than just \"quite okay\" about her if she hadn't moaned every time she ate something, but like I said, she wasn't that bad. I actually loved that she stood her ground and never considered going back to her cheating ex-fiancé, unlike our hero who wasn't so sure about it and who, speaking of which — let's get to him now.\n\nMiles Nowak, our Bridget Jones's Diary-watching, spicy-woodsy-smelling (like every other romance book hero), Crocs-loving hero who as for now is my least favorite Emily Henry male character. Yes, he had some good moments, but instead of screaming, blushing, and kicking my feet for how wonderful he was with Daphne, I kept thinking about these facts about him\n\n\n\"Miles looks up at me.\n“They,” I say, “suck.”\n“She’s the love of my life,” he says.\n“The love of your life sucks,” I tell him.\"\n\n\nThe love of your life? Hell no. I didn't like that he said that about his cheating ex-girlfriend, so I expected him to say the same thing about the heroine later in the book, but that didn't happen. I know he loved Daphne and chose her, but this quote left a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nOr when the question was asked \"if they would get back together with their exes\" and Daphne's answer was this\n\n\n\"Would he take her back? I find myself wondering, before seamlessly transitioning into Would I take Peter back? “Definitely not,” I say aloud.\"\n\n\nand Miles’s that\n\n\n\"Petra was the exception, not the rule, for me. So if she wanted to get back together? I don’t know. But it’s not worth thinking about, since she’s engaged to your ex-boyfriend.”\n\n\nShe cheated on you with her best friend?!? What do you mean \"I don’t know.\"?? It should have been \"No.\" from the very beginning when you found out about it.\n\nThe worst moment in the book that confirmed me why he is my least favorite Emily Henry hero was when he went to see his ex when she called him crying and because of that he left Daphne waiting for him.\n\n\n\"And then Petra called, and she was sobbing. So hard I couldn’t understand her. I’d never seen her cry before. I honestly thought someone had died. She asked if I could come see her, and I said yes. Because I was worried. I still care about her.”\n\n\nShe cheated on you and then a month later was engaged to her best friend!?! What do mean you still care about her??\n\n\n\"I didn’t mean to tell her first.” The tops of his cheeks redden. “That I’m in love with you.\"\n\n\nAnd then the first person to know he loved Daphne was also his ex. You know that feeling when you read a romance novel and you just feel that the hero loves the heroine? In Miles' case it was the opposite. Throughout the book, I had the impression that if his ex-girlfriend wanted to come back to him, he would welcome her with open arms. Only at the end of the book, when he did one thing, I was like \"Hmm, okay, maybe he loves Daphne then.\". But as I just said, I only started feeling it at the end of the book. All the things I mentioned, plus the fact that a month after the breakup he still kept pictures of her in his room instead of burning them, are why he will probably always be my least favorite Emily character.\n\n\nI don't even know what to say about the romance part of the book because it was boring as the chemistry between Daphne and Miles seemed non-existent to me. They finally confessed their love to each other, and the only thing I felt was happiness, because I knew that this book would end soon. I guess that alone says enough how much I enjoyed their love story.\n\n\nI never expected that reading Emily Henry's book would evoke so many unpleasant emotions in me, and yet, as you can see, it unfortunately happened. I hope I'm in the minority of people who feel this way, because Emily's book being one of the biggest disappointments of the year wasn’t on my bingo card.\n\n\n\n────────\n\nMe at my graduation: 😐\nMe at my wedding: 😐\nMe when Emily Henry announces a new book: 😍😍😩😩😻😻😻😍🥰🥰😍🥰\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "I give this book 4.5 stars, rounded up to steamy forced proximity, friends to lovers, opposites attraction. In no way can I give any Emily Henry book less than five stars.\n\nThis book isn't my favorite among Emily Henry's works. \"Happy Place\" holds that position, while \"People We Meet on Vacation\" is my least favorite of hers. (By the way, both earned five stars from me, so I have to work on a different grading system for Henry’s books like triple five stars, minus five stars, etc. But I'm sure each of her books will become my favorite romance readings of the year, even though Colleen Hoover releases a book at the same time. Yep, ColHo fans, I’m one of yours, but fair is fair! Emily Henry is a true musician and poet playing the strings of my heart.)\n\nBut let's be honest: Miles Nowak is the BEST BOYFRIEND Emily Henry has created! He’s caring, a charm magnet, selfless, easy-going, adventurous – not only the best boyfriend but also the best male friend any woman seeks. His irresistible hotness is the cherry on top. I'm usually irritated by the heroes Emily Henry creates, but so far, Miles has exceeded them with his good heart, sense of humor, naturalness, without having a selfish bone in his body!\n\nI have to admit I had doubts when I first decided to read this book because I've never been a fan of love triangles or ex-lover situations. When they are involved, things get messier, and emotions get blurrier. Most characters do something irritating, missing the ex or trying to rekindle, which pisses me off.\n\nI won't give spoilers, but I can say this: the situation of becoming roommates with your ex-fiancée’s new fiancée’s ex-boyfriend couldn’t be handled very gently and fairly. Both Daphne and Miles are wise, analyzing their situations very reasonably. When they accidentally find themselves in a fake dating situation, they even share their thoughts honestly. That’s why I loved both of the characters. They know their own flaws, weaknesses, and they don’t whine or obsess over their exes. They hold each other to get through the trauma, and from their mutual tragic incident, a beautiful, unique friendship is born. I loved how they slowly lowered down their barriers, learning to explore themselves and the huge life awaiting them. They acted so mature and were so careful not to be each other’s rebound, even though the sparks fly and burn the apartment they share to the ground.\n\nThe plot revolves around Daphne, who loves the story of how she met her fiancée Peter until he dumps her after the bachelor party to choose his childhood friend Petra over her, giving her one week to move from their shared house, heading to the Amalfi Coast with his new girlfriend! Yes, what a jerk! Homeless and hopeless, Daphne, who recently left her old life behind to start a new life with Peter, finds Miles: Petra’s dumped a few minutes ago boyfriend at Peter’s door, and she pops up the question: is there any vacant room at your apartment?\n\nYes, the equation might be too complicated. Daphne: reserved, tight-lipped, buttoned-up children’s librarian living with a carefree, adventurous, pothead guy who is working odd jobs, as her ex-fiancée defined. But when they get an invitation to Petra & Peter’s wedding, their very reserved roommate relationship changes after a night ends at the bar, and both of them decide to RSVP to the wedding. And guess what? The same day Peter makes a pity call that leads Daphne to lie about her relationship situation with Miles. She says they are dating, and thankfully Miles plays along with her game.\n\nBut what if she misjudged Miles from the beginning? This self-deprecating, friendly guy who always puts others before him, comes to the library to cheer him up when she reads books to the kids, takes him places in town she has never seen, helps her open her mind and heart, rediscovering herself. Is he the guy her heart wants?\n\nWell, I loved Miles, I loved Daphne & Miles' love story, and the beautiful epilogue in the end! No more words! Emily Henry never disappoints me! She meticulously solved this challenging relationship equation with the best possible outcome! Go on! Read, reread, and reread this lovely book!\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book’s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\n\nmedium.com\ninstagram\nfacebook\ntwitter\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "my heart is broken. i feel like i'm dying. the world holds nothing for me anymore.\n\ni'm three starring this book.\n\ni adore emily henry, and i have since her magical realism days. i'd happily read her to-do lists if she released them once a year, and i'm sure even those would have more banter and loveliness and whimsy than your average full-length release just by virtue of being written by her. i'd say the same about her grocery lists, but i already do read those. (the woman writes a mean substack.)\n\nthere were a few things i didn't love about this book. it tries to fit so much into a few hundred pages: our protagonist, daphne, is left by her fiance weeks before her wedding, causing her to: move in with miles, her fiance's new girlfriend's ex-boyfriend; realize she has no friends; begin a quest to find herself; get over the fiancé and fall in love with miles; join a variety of community groups and neighborhood activities; make her current job her dream job; repress some CLEAR mommy issues i thought we were going to address, and fully get over her daddy issues.\n\nall of this is happening so much.\n\nit comes at a cost, which is that typical emily henry magic (and i don't just mean the bygone magical realism i mourn every day and never shut up about).\n\nthis book is not quite as funny — jokes feel forced, sometimes to the point that you can only identify something as reaching for funny because the character \"joked\" or \"played along\" instead of \"said.\"\n\nit is not quite as polished, with writing feeling a bit unconfident, full of words italicized for emphasis and, you know, the whole verbs that aren't said thing. (there are a LOT of dialogue attribution words that aren't \"said.\")\n\nand the characters have none of their usual better-version-of-reality charm. miles' nick miller archetype would never work for me personally, but my real issue with him is that his character traits fade once we're supposed to see him as a romantic prospect. our side characters, ashleigh and julia, feel like interchangeable joke-bots to the point of being vaguely threatening. (when they pop up on page in tandem i feel a sense of unease.)\n\nand to be honest, daphne has no self awareness. because there's so much happening in this book, everything has to be incredibly simple: daphne's issue with her dad, AND daphne's issue with miles, AND daphne's friends' issue with daphne all has to be the same. it makes for some moments of ridiculousness — like how can daphne be melting down about being wronged on the same city block where she realized several hours earlier she had wronged someone in that exact same way? how could she be so unwilling to give the grace she expects for herself? and how could emily henry set scenes of this book on a cherry farm in michigan when she knew what it would do to me, specifically?!\n\nsorry. that's the last time i'll bring up magical realism. i think.\n\nol' daph just has too much to figure out about herself. i think this abandonment would be so completely traumatic even if she HADN'T built her entire life around her fiancé only to be left entirely alone, and even if it WASN'T eerily similar to her daddy issues, and even if she DIDN'T have a bunch of unresolved things going on up in ye olde memory palace, that the last thing she'd be doing is sticking around someone else's hometown flirting with her new roomie.\n\nespecially since what she ends up doing is repeating the exact same cycle with no awareness at all.\n\nand in the worst offense, miles' illiterate texting style reminded me of the himbos i used to date (date doing a lot of heavy lifting here) in my wayward youth. which should be a jailable offense in and of itself.\n\nbottom line: like anything emily henry has ever written, this is better than a lot of books. it just isn't better than most emily henry ones.\n\n----------------------\ncurrently-reading update\n\nme arriving to the world's biggest emily henry fan contest but my competition is all of goodreads\n\n(GUYS IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING)\n\nthanks to the publisher for the e-arc\n\n----------------------\ntbr review\n\ni would like to request that no one talk to me about anything that isn't this for the next 3 to 5 business years.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "to preface this review, i love and adore emily henry's books. book lovers is in my top 5 books of all time (and i am not a romance reader), and happy place is the only book that made me cry last year. time is truly measured in emily henry releases for me.\n\nmy current emily henry rom com ranking is: book lovers (5 stars), happy place (5 stars), beach read (4.5 stars), funny story (3 stars), and people we meet on vacation (2.5 stars). if we have completely different rankings, you'll probably feel differently about this book!\n\nif you are a big romance reader (reading books for the romance), you will most likely enjoy this a lot. but if you are a lit fic reader who loves emily henry books for the protagonists and their introspection and the fact that her romance feels grounded and realistic (me), this might be a slight miss. it's been a while since i've described an emily henry book as just \"good\", but this one feels like that for me.\n\nfunny story still has emily henry's signature witty dialogue and chemistry between miles and daphne. it is arguably her most commercial romance to date, filled with more romantic scenes between the two characters. daphne, after being dumped by her fiancé for his best friend, decides to room with miles, who was dumped by said best friend. in classic emily henry rom com style, funny story is set in a beautiful town in the midwest (michigan), charged with quick banter and heart to hearts between the characters. in this vein, the book felt like a mix of beach read and book lovers, in a sense.\n\nbut not really. while it's impossible for me to dislike a emily henry book because of her writing, much of my enjoyment as a reader comes from being able to see myself and parts of my personality reflected through either protagonist. for book lovers, it was overwhelmingly nora, for happy place, it was harriet, for beach read, it was gus, and for people we meet on vacation, it was alex. and so on.\n\nthe main qualm i had with funny story is that neither miles nor daphne felt relatable to me, which made it a less enjoyable read than her other books. this is why i say that my neutral stance on this book is most likely a personal one. daphne and miles both felt very confusing to me as characters, almost as if they were hybrids of emily henry's previous characters. i couldn't quite get either of their characterizations or defining traits. there is not a single emily henry book i didn't read in one sitting...until this one.\n\nlike i mentioned above, a big reason for my love for emily henry books is her protagonists and how their introspection does not read like other commercial romance books, but more like literary fiction. her characters are well thought through, reflective, and very three dimensional. nora was literally just me from start to finish (so i don't have to really put forth a defense about three dimensionality). harriet's introspection on loneliness and living for other people genuinely changed my life. but daphne didn't really have any.\n\nthe chemistry and get-together also felt a bit rushed and forced at times, and the dialogue and heart to hearts felt less genuine and blander than her other books. for a book called funny story, it was...not. i think my big issue was just with miles as well. he just didn't enough charisma and charm for this book to be memorable for me. wyn and alex didn't really either, but i related a lot to alex and wyn was redeemed through harriet.\n\nfunny story is a great read and definitely still a cut above other romance books. but this one just didn't do it for me. i really hope her next release works for me!\n\nthank you berkley for the arc!\n\n⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻\n\ni didn't love this i'm sorry guys\n\nreview to come\n\n\n⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻\n\nI GOT THE ARC WHOOOOOOO\n\n⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻\n\nemily henry ! do you want my firstborn? my college diploma? my kidney? you name it, it’s yours !!!\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "4 stars!\n\ni have now read three emily henry books, and while she is undoubtedly a talented writer, what i find most fascinating is the loyalty of her readers; going to your nearest bookstore on release day for a book that is probably no less than $30 — that’s dedication. and you know what, i think i finally get it.\n\ni didn’t have particularly high expectations for funny story, but in all transparency, this just might be my favorite book of hers, hovering right above beach read (which i thoroughly enjoyed) and book lovers (of which i have no recollection but still think highly). it’s far from perfect, but it does a lot of things well, and that’s quite a feat considering it’s less than 400 pages (proof that less is more!) and, according to the reviews i’ve seen, her most “romantic” romance novel yet.\n\nstill — i think funny story, like her other books, straddles the line between lighthearted romcom and introspective women’s fiction. the banter in this one is some of the best she’s written — it’s reread worthy, the kind that makes you laugh out loud. the characters themselves are wonderfully written; it’s obvious that emily henry adores them. she crafted miles and daphne with so much care and thought, adding dimension to the characters through their experiences and focusing on how said experiences changed and ultimately shaped them into the miles and daphne we read about in this book. it’s rare for me to like one mc in a romance book, let alone both, but daphne felt so relatable — her thoughts mirrored my very own at times. and miles i had a soft spot for because how could you not? he’s this is me trying personified. and the romance? god, the romance. i’m a harsh rater, even more so when it comes to contemporary romance. but in every! one! of! her! books! emily henry prioritizes the emotional connection between the two main characters. and the way she develops their relationship and has them slowly open up to each other? it gets me. every. time. i live for their vulnerable moments, for their conversations about their pasts, about what haunts them, as much as i live for their banter.\n\ndespite this being first and foremost a romance, it is also a story about rediscovering yourself, relearning who you are and what you like and what you want out of life. it’s a reminder to live for yourself, to spend your days with the people you love, to love them without restraint or inhibition. the ending is beautifully uplifting, the last sentence tying back to the very first, the tone hopeful and reassuring. it’s what i think i needed right now as someone who’s entering her twenties and is so intimidated by the unknown, who’s tempted to run away from the unpredictability of it all. and i’m sure it’s a book i’ll come back to when, in five years, my life will probably make even less sense than it does now.\n\nthank you to netgalley and berkley publishing for the arc 💓\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Can a book survive on nothing but banter? Well, Funny Story sure tries.\n\nOkay, all you rabid Emily Henry fans. Before you chuck your rotten eggs at me, please let me explain.\n\nIf ever there was an Emily Henry book that I should connect with, it's this one. Daphne is a librarian (my dream job) and she's in a pretend relationship with her roommate, Miles, in order to get back at her ex-fiancé (an intriguing premise). And yet, something was missing. I kept waiting for the story to grab me, and it never really did.\n\nI hate to say it, but the crux of the problem is that the whole thing was rather forgettable. I only just finished the book, and already I hardly remember anything about it. The characters, the interactions, even the conflicts, while all feelgood on the surface, were in fact fairly bland underneath.\n\nI enjoy a low-stakes beach read as much as the next gal, but there is a difference between low stakes and no stakes, and this was too much in the latter. At no point was there anything really on the line. The story just shambled along, with lots of banter and some minor conflicts here and there, until the requisite 300-some pages were met, and then it was called a book.\n\nSpeaking of the conflicts, I totally didn't understand Daphne and Miles' issues, or even Daphne and Ashleigh's. Do people really get so upset and potentially break up relationships and friendships over such small issues? And each one, blown up to be so important, can only be resolved after much back and forth, with pages upon pages of dialogue of each person's feelings and the associated parental trauma that was at the root of all their misgivings. It was a bit much.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I did have fun. There were entertaining moments, and the banter was truly top notch. And it wasn't just for the main couple during romantic moments. No, the banter was interspersed everywhere and among everyone, so we got plenty of chuckle-worthy moments.\n\nBut you can't just sustain a story on banter alone, no matter how delightful it is. When the characters feel as lackluster as Daphne and Miles and their conflicts equally bland and forced, it was hard to care either way if they ended up together, which is always a bad sign in a romance.\n\nI feel like I'm the only person out there who doesn't get heart-eyes at the merest mention of an Emily Henry book. My experiences so far have been largely underwhelming, or maybe I just haven't read the right books by her. Either way, I'll add this to the pile of Emily Henry books I've pretty much forgotten the moment I finished.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSee also, my thoughts on:\nBeach Read\nPeople We Meet on Vacation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "funny story? ha. ain’t nothing funny about the way my heart was tugged while reading this book. emily henry im under your bed cuz why’d you write a fmc that has the same thoughts and fears as me?!? 💀\n\nopposites attract has never been written better than before this. Daphne and Miles were written for each other like a prophecy. this is one of emily’s most horniest books yet, and i was there for it all the way through. “his mouth is still cool from the lemonade, his breath tinged with hints of lavender, and his hand slides around to the small of my back, fisting into my shirt…” i love these descriptions. there was something very tender when he said “always so buttoned up” to Daphne, who’s a librarian, as he was ripping her clothes off. 🫶🏽\n\ni just know if i had an attentive, calm, loving, cherishing, beautiful man like Miles in my life he’d be extremely manly to the point where i can turn off my brain, be a girly girl, and not have a worry in the world. his gentle love felt like a caress to my soul. the way he effortlessly took care of her, saw the signs, respected her space and mind. Miles…YOU GOT IT LIKE THAT?!? he makes me feel like im standing in sunlight☀️\n\nlives were changed when Miles said, “ I know I’m not who you pictured yourself with, but I think I could be, eventually. If you’ll let me. So don’t go. Because I don’t want you to. Because you’re my best friend, and I’m in love with you.” brother my knees just hit the floor in the middle of walmart😭\n\nDaphne such a well rounded character. her fears were so real and the way she overcame them was nothing if not humbling. emily writes her fmc so nuanced and layered and deep. i feel like she’s writing about me and im ok with that 😁\n\nalso if i ever catch Peter in public im throwing a brick at him\n\nemily henry books ranking:\n1) beach read\n2) funny story\n3) book lovers\n4) people we meet on vacation\n5) happy place\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "i'm all for recycling but does she have to keep writing the same book every year\n\n\nboring. repetitive. bland characters. a mc that moans every time she eats something (is this some kind of weird new sex thing. was i supposed to be turned on. sparks were definitely flying but that's just because i considered setting myself and the book on fire multiple times). i was actually gonna give this two stars but the more i think about it the more i hate it. also i'm in a very bad mood. lol.\n\n\ni have said it with book lovers before and i will say it again: all her books feel the same. wake me up in two days time and yell the names alex, gus, and miles at me and i will struggle assigning them to the right books. i don't even remember happy places mmc... and i actually liked that book... meh whatever.\n\n\nthose two had about the same amount of chemistry as me and that work project i have been putting off for weeks because it bores me to death just thinking about. watching paint dry would have been more exciting than reading this. maybe it isn't too late yet. someone get me a brush.\n\n\nmy theory concerning emily henry's popularity on goodreads is that she always writes about female characters that in one shape or another love books. and... that's basically most of the demographic here so. which is fine and yay yippiee juhu, representation (the poor underrepresented class of *checks notes* white cishet female readers) but like .... please write a book that isn't just the previous ones rearranged and glued together?\n\n\nalso, the story wasn't even funny???\nShow more",

It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about.”\n\nYou guys do not know how excited I am to write this review because this book meant so much to me and I honestly didnt think a book could mean so much to someone until I read this 🥺 It was so beautifully written, with such emotion, Only one book has managed to make me cry (As long as the lemon trees grow\") while this one did not make me sob, It brought me so close to it when I read the epilogue because it was perfect 🙂‍↕️✋🏻 I could have binged this book in one sitting because I was literally free but I was so attached to these characters that I was delaying an inevitable goodbye which hit me so hard because within a span of 400 pages, they gave me so much and took it all away as I closed the book 😔✋🏻 Reading this book was such a serene experience, makes me want to read every Abby book out there because this was fucking beautiful. I have never in my life read a book filled with so much feeling, such perfect representation of guilt, self-hate, anxiety and neglect as this 😮‍💨\n\nThis book perfectly captures gut-wrenching moments mixed with feel-good, heartfelt moments, written with so much emotion that it honestly felt like I was experiencing all this in real life with them with me because there is no way a book can have me on the verge of tears imagining them sitting together as they laugh and live a happy life or make me feel so angry at a character for treating her daughter so bad and I can not stress on how the slow burn made me feel AHHH!! I wanted everything and it eventually gave me everything 😭. The writing was simply breathtaking, it reminded me so much of Emily Henry because usually her books are the type to make me feel this way. The way it described love is gonna make you believe in it 🩷\n\nI feel like another way to look at why this book is so perfect for us is because we had unbelievably high expectations like you do not know how high are expectations were, we singlehandedly believed that this would be our summer read and the anticipation that led to this book because were waiting to read it in June but my copy took a month to arrive and then one thing led to another and before we knew it, and we learned that you need to read the first two books (not true, this could be read as a stand alone) 😭😭 but for a better experience we did and we really enjoyed these two but they can not be compared to this masterpiece. It was everything, it managed to exceed everyone of our expectations and we loved every second of it 😌 This showed how good of a book this was.\n\nThe characters in this book were so fucking precious 🥹. I wanted hug all of them because they all deserved so much better than what they got, We follow two characters Emma and Justin who meet over a twitter thread and having similar relationship problems enter a fling 'Just for the summer' and one thing leads to another and to know more you would have to read this book because so much happens and I am still stuck in those moments 😔😮‍💨✋🏻\n\n“You're not asking too much,\" he said. \"You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.”\n\nJustin was the epitome of 'If he wanted to he would' because he did!! 😌 I love how good Abby Jimenez's men are. All of them are literally green flags. He was everything that you would look for a man. That man was the standard because no one has ever put themselves out that much for anyone, he was fully committed, the way he comforted and understood Emma's trauma and pain and tried to give her time and be there for her was so precious for me because this should be the bare minimum tbh these days, he did all this while struggling himself with his mom going to jail and him having to take care of his family, all of it put together complimented the book well.\n\nI mean how can you not love him, he's 6ft, charming, charismatic, funny and has dimples + is a software engineer and uses his skills to make fun things for his gf 🤭. I love, love, loved the effort that he put into this relationship and I also love the found family aspect that we got because of him, this whole series tying up to this moment felt like a massive found family and I was in love with it.\n\n“In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy,”\n\nEmma was such a strong character tbh because it's so hard to find books without any annoying female characters and I was so happy when I found Emma to be so realistic and relatable 😭 I wont agree with anyone saying Emma didn't deal with anything in a mature way-✋🏻 Live with a mother who abandons you and neglects you and then judge her✋🏻. Emma was so cute, I loved her and I literally grew so close to her and so fond of her that everything that came rolling down on her made me so sad and angry. I loved the way her character looked at the world, where she would look at things with more empathy and would encourage people to do that as well. People like her are a gem and should be protected at all costs 🩷\n\nI hated Emma's mother sm 😡 she made me furious because what she did was unforgivable!! to think that Emma could have gotten so much love and such a nice past- but she didn't because Amber the fucking bitch was to selfish to do that, she would abandon her and ruin her life, would make her feel like shit and would not care for her or more or less pay attention to her 💔 Especially chapter 41 where she talks to him (yk who) and he tells her about his past and she thinks that's it could've been for her.\n\n“Maybe home isn’t a place. Maybe it’s a person.”\n\nMaddy is the friend we alll want and I am so happy and thankful to god for giving me friends like her because she was perfect. She understood Emma so well, gave her reality checks and supported her, helped Justin figure her out and overall I just loved how she was there for her always. I also loved Emma's relationship with Justin's brother and I liked how Justin and Emma rekindled because of them<333\n\n“What are you thinking?” I asked. He didn’t answer for a long moment. When he did, he did it with his eyes closed. “All I ever think about is you.”\n\nThe romance was everything that I ever wanted. It was everything. I loved it so much that I literally have no words to describe it, it made me feel every emotion that is out there to exist 🥹 Justin and Emma were made for each other, it was everything that I was looking for in a moment, there banter alone was so well done and their chemistry was perfect tbh. Their domestic scenes had me swooning 😮‍💨 where they would cook together and help the kids and I loved how she would just extend her trip. That first kiss scene literally gave me and Emma both butterflies, it was so well done. Although it's supposed to be a fling but there's so much slow burn and angst and tension filled in this book 🥵 The perfect balance of everything. Like its the perfect fucking combo for everyone out there. I genuinely would read it every year/ every summer.\n\nScenes that I absolutely loved:\n\n1, Justin making Emma pre-date questionnaires and giving her invitations 🤭\n\n2, the whole toilet king banter 😭���🏻\n\n3, Dual pov 🙂‍↕️\n\n4, The confrontation between Emma and her mother 🥺\n\n5, Chapter 40 😨\n\n6, Justin paddle boating his way through to get on an island just because Emma called him and told him that she was sick 🥹\n\n7, The airport hotel scene between Maddy and Emma 🫂\n\n8, Sarah emergency contact list scene + JustinEmma domestic scenes 🩷\n\n9, Justin and Emma on the date where Leigh and his mom crash with them 🤣\n\n10, the first and the last chapter 🩷🫂\n\n“The moment Emma came into view, my entire world slipped into slow motion. My brain took a screenshot. I felt the moment freeze and save. She was beautiful.”\n\nThe plot (Spoilers will be mentioned) started off so cute with the whole fling and it served well for their banter and chemistry and I was excited to see where all of it would go tbh because I wanted to see how all of it would end and oh my god that plot twist that came and hit us?? like me and Roxy were shooketh like we could have figured this out so fast but we were so blind like we were actually so blind and Jimenez did such a mega job keeping us distracted with Justin and Emma that we didnt even figure out the elephant in the room SPOILERS umm chapter 40?? Daniel and Emma being siblings?? I felt so bad for her when Daniel and her talked and Amber was litr mentioned + Neil was right there HOW did we not notice him LMAOO. anyways I liked how Daniel and Emma got their good moments and she had a better life and found someone to love just because of a summer fling SPOILERS END\n\nOverall, an amazing read!! I went in with extremely high expectations and read every single word there was to read!! Would definitely recommend!\n\nSome of the quotes that I loved;\n“The love stories sold us the wrong thing. The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about. Taking the end piece of the bread at breakfast so she can have the last middle piece for her sandwich when you pack her lunch. Making sure her car always has gas so she never has to stop at the pump. Telling her you’re not cold and to take your jacket when you are in fact, very, very cold. It’s watching TV on a rainy Sunday while you’re doing laundry and turning her light off when she’s fallen asleep reading. Sharing pizza crusts and laughing about something the kids did and taking care of each other when you’re sick. It isn’t glamorous, it isn’t all butterflies and stars in your eyes. It’s real. This is the kind of love that forever is made of. Because if it’s this good when life is draining and mundane and hard, think of how wonderful it will be when the love songs are playing and the moon is out.”\n.\n“Sometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.”\n.\n“Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don’t know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.”\n.\n“Sometimes I feel like the seasons could come and go and come and go, a hundred years could pass, a thousand, the ground could collapse under us, this house could crumble and go back to the earth, and we would still be standing here frozen in time, because every second I’m with you is eternal. I’ve never felt anything like it.”\n.\n“Because when you’re in love, you do hard things.”\n.\n“I’ve been waiting my whole life to feel like this and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn’t. It’s just that they weren’t you.”\n.\n“To me, love meant you stayed. But now I understood that love sometimes means you let someone go.”\n.\n“This is the thing nobody tells you about The One. How they’re timeless. How the moment they pop up again you’re right back in it, right where you left off.”\n.\n“Tell me your day today from start to finish.”\n____\nThis book fucking ruined me\n\nEasily my favourite book of the year 😭\n___\nIn Roxy's wise words \"This better be revolutionary‼️\"\n\n•Buddy reading with Roxy\n__\nPlease, please, please be THE summer romance book.

This was my first book by Abby Jimenez and it put me off to the point that am no longer sure if I want to read any of her other books.\n\n✔️ Online meet cute\n✔️ Insta lovey\n✔️ Found family\n\nThis was one of the most bland and emotionless writing I have read in a while. There were no feelings to it, I surely did not feel a single thing reading it. The plot execution was so messy and had no direction.\n\nThe romance was very mid. The two characters start off okay but then their personalities clash. The chemistry is meh. They do have some cute moments but I could not feel a single thing for them.\n\nJustin and Emma have issues of their own but Justin deals with things a tad more maturely compared to Emma. Sure, I feel bad for Emma but the way her story and character was written is just so damn boring. Justin's siblings were more cute and I would rather read about them than this tiresome book.\n\nI skimmed it towards the end and have no regrets. I realize that it's probably just me who didn't like it but please go in with low expectations.\n\nAlso, what is the purpose of marketing it as a standalone if we have to read her other books first in order to start liking it?!\n\n~•~•~\nFound family? Forced proximity? Summer fling? Online meet cute? SO EXCITEDDD to start with it!!! ^_^\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "WOW. This book gives golden retriever 'IF HE WANTED TO HE WOULD' MMC and a complex, good hearted, kind and layered FMC who when brought together, make this story magical. The chemistry is something I could almost reach my hand out and FEEL radiating off the page. The honesty, and communication was so refreshing to see characters who whilst setting boundaries, and being carefree with each other also unashamedly sharing feelings with one another. The banter and just silliness that leaves a smile stretched on your face makes the feel goodness of this book undeniable. As always Abby Jimenez serves an amazing romance with such a deeply emotional plot as a side and the two mixed together in this book made it absolutely incredible. 5 🌟\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "SO GOOD!! I was at 4.25ish stars for the first half and then THE ENDING was so good!!!\n\nI loveee Justin. He is the epitome of if he wanted to he would. And Emma! I love that she was such a realistic character. She was so kind and amazing but also had such a heartbreaking past and so much to work through. I thought they were both perfect for what each other needed🥹\n\nFavorite Abby Jiminez book so far! I think this one is really going to stick with me for a long time.\nShow more",

        "Review 10": "Oh boy! Too many words come to mind at once, creating a huge cacophony. They're not enough to express how much I loved this book. Great, brilliant, adorable words aren't doing justice for this most poignant book, and even the best couple and best book boyfriend (OMG: don’t you think Justin is like cinnamon rolls meets mud pie? This character completely changed my perspective about the name, although I still think both Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake are rubbing me the wrong way) created by Abby Jimenez.\n\nI used to think “Part of Your World” was her best work, but “Just for the Summer” exceeded it with Toilet King references, fantastic dating options, so many ugly cries, and sweetest, sighing, swoon-smile-repeat moments blended in heavy triggering subjects that are handled with care and in a realistic way, including PTSD, panic attacks, death, child neglect, dysfunctional family, and mental health issues.\n\nThe witty and sweet dialogues, catchy banters, physical attraction, and emotional intimacy, along with the perfect chemistry between Emma and Justin, are pure perfection! Even though they met through a Reddit thread that turned into humorous messages and sweet phone calls during the hardest times of their lives, their blooming friendship and curse-breaking designated dates—including four dates, one kiss, and a breakup—are a scenario doomed to fail when the attraction hits the roof.\n\nAnother best part of the book is seeing cameos from the “Part of Your World” universe. Seeing those favorite characters in this book made me smile a lot.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the plot:\n\nThe book opens with a laugh-out-loud “Am I the asshole?” Reddit thread written by Justin, a cute, caring 29-year-old engineer who sees his situation as a good luck charm, meaning each woman he dates finds their significant other immediately after their breakup, and they even invite him to their weddings.\n\nEmma, a 28-year-old traveling nurse, reads this thread during her lunch break with her bestie Maddie, and she decides to DM the guy because she’s also the good luck charm that every man she dates marries immediately after the breakup. Justin decides to write her back, which turns into very entertaining correspondences. A few days later, they start talking on the phone, and eventually Justin comes up with an interesting offer: if they date each other and break up, they can also break the curse and have a chance to find their soulmates. Emma finds this plan unreasonable at first. She and Maddy had already decided to fly to Hawaii for their rest residence, but as long as she spends more time with Justin on the phone, she decides to change her plans and rent a cozy cottage in Minnesota for only six weeks to help her realize their date plan.\n\nShe even plays the guilt card to convince Maddy. The plan is simple: they’ll date only for a few weeks, kiss each other goodbye, and ride off into the sunset with their own future soulmates. But when sparks start flying around them and their first meeting turns into being hit by a love truck, the detailed plans, which included more surveys and questionnaires, are fated to fail. Especially when both of them struggle with unexpected mommy-related family issues, which push them toward each other, and Emma, who resists taking people into her heart, finds herself letting not only Justin but his entire family in. Could she learn to set roots somewhere? Could she learn to dissect the barriers to make herself small and open her heart fully to love and be cherished in return?\n\nOverall: three words, “I loved it,” and two more words, “read it”! This is one of the best romance novels of the year, and don’t you dare miss it!\n\nOh boy, I couldn’t tell you how much I appreciate this digital reviewer copy I received and how thankful I am to NetGalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for sending me this ARC copy in exchange for my honest review. And thanks a lot to Abby Jimenez for writing this book, lighting up my mood, making me laugh till my stomach aches, and making me cry till I had the best raccoon makeup.\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\n\nmedium.com\ninstagram\nfacebook\ntwitter<\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "update: 4/27/24\npeople are so funny. they preach about respecting people’s opinions and that everyone is entitled to it but contradict themselves and get hurt the moment they see someone rating a book 1-star and writing “a whole essay” on why they didn't like it. you poor thing, hurt over a stranger’s opinion over a book. on a book reviewing site. where we can all share our own thoughts. what has 2024 come to, right? i’ve decided to turn off comments and not let non-friends comment on reviews, as well as go private, cause people can’t understand that this is a public book reviewing site where we are all entitled to say what we want about a book we didn’t like. i’d like to remind everyone that this is my third ali hazelwood book and i read it because it was a paranormal romance, not a contemporary stem romance like the rest. y’all like to read but clearly didn’t read where i stated this.\n\nalso, if you guys think this review is a whole essay, don't look at my full, coherent reviews. ALSO, if i wanna write an essay, you bet i will. i didn’t know there were rules to how we choose to write reviews! 🫣\n\ntelling me to grow up but y’all are mad i didn't like your 2010 wattpad vampyre romance over a character named misery. y’all are miserable just like her name. commenting on reviews because you’re mad. 😂 you guys care way too much how strangers spend their own time, it's concerning.\n\nin reply to most comments i get:\n“get a job” i do, and it pays well. it pays more than enough for myself, for my bills, and for my food.\n“get a life” says the one commenting on a review they disagree with.\n“why spend your time reading her books” because i can. thanks for caring about how i chose to spend my own time.\n“did you need to write a whole essay?” did they never teach you in class how to write essays? these are bullet points. there’s a difference. but if i wanna write an ‘essay’ over a book i didn’t like, i will. maybe teach yourself what the words opinion and decision means.\n“it’s not that serious” so why are you mad?\n“you’re boring” good thing we aren’t friends.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nif ali hazelwood has 1000 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 100 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 50 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 1 hater, i’m me. if ali hazelwood has no haters, it means i am dead. if the world is with ali hazelwood, then i am against the world.\n\nother actual thought because i did actually read this…this:\n• enemies to lovers WHERE? it is never to be seen. not even an ounce of it.\n• do authors not get second hand embarrassment giving their characters terrible names like misery and lowe??\n• vampYres instead of vampires is the cherry on top\n• that cover is giving 2013 wattpad era\n• i felt no chemistry between the characters. it’s too bad because their friendship and slow burn had potential.\n• of course he growls, hisses and has a very husky voice\n• don’t forget he’s So Big. his shoe size is 14, because that is very important and necessary information. his hand is also so big it engulfs her own. he towers over her because He’s Huge. DO NOT FORGET!\n• obviously he never actually Hated Her, he just had to kinda pretend. she just thinks he does because he can’t stand the smell of her. kinda like when edward was near bella that first time and she thought she reeked? yeah, like that. so she carried this misconception about what he thinks about her but OBVIOUSLY he just, has always liked her. he has been secretly obsessed with her, because when are they not secretly obsessed but pretend they are not? never.\n• OF COURSE he’s broody and grumpy and can be mean in the outside but is actually a Big Softie deep down inside. DUH!\n• misery is quite possibly the most oblivious, useless, boring, weakest, most lame vampire i have ever read about. her being a vampire is actually really irrelevant that you might even forget she’s a vampire. she doesn’t know the difference between a ladle and spatula. ali really likes making her heroines really fucking stupid.\n• don’t ask me what she looks like because i wouldn’t know. all i know is that she bleeds purple and has pointy ears, which is a weird feature for vampires but whatever. it seems like this author still doesn’t like describing to her readers her characters enough to make them visualizing.\n• absolutely bland, boring, and very unflavored mmc, just like the rest. he’s a werewolf, has hair that is short and a rich brown cut to a buzz, is the alpha, has broad shoulders…that’s it. anything new? no, obviously. he growls and hisses, but this time he is an artist, i guess, who draws the mc, and takes care of a child.\n• this was only my third read from this author. i’ve read The Love Hypothesis and Love on the Brain, but i’ve avoided everything published after ‘love on the brain’ because i know i wouldn’t enjoy them. fortunately, i don’t have any desire to read them. i read this because it’s the first paranormal romance by this author, and, for some reason, i thought the genre would mean this would be different. that was not the case for me, obviously. i don’t think i’ll be reading this author again in the future unless serena and koen get their story cause that ending?? 👀\n• terrible job of world-building. this author needs to stick to contemporaries. not only does this author not give enough physical descriptions about her characters features but the world building is severely lacking. there is little to no explanation of where and how everything happened. we really just get the basic information necessary. a lot of info dump in the beginning—historical context, names, wars, systems, political diplomatic views, etc. everything piled together.\n• formulaic, boring, cliché, and immature writing. i can’t even say it’s because this author started off writing fanfiction on ao3 when so many fanfics on ao3 (and even wattpad) are written immensely better than this. so many books published yet this this authors writing hasn’t improved since her debut. i guess when you write a book like the love hypothesis, your quality of books isn’t important anymore because you know your targeted audience will eat up the bare minimum. the characters in this might as well be the same as her previous characters except they’re in a paranormal setting.\n• if you are excited for this, take my review with a grain of salt as i haven’t enjoyed this author before so just because i didn’t like it, doesn’t mean you won’t. a lot of my friends love this author and her stories. if you haven’t read ali before, you might like it! or, if read her before and have an idea what to expect and don’t care about the formulaic writing, you might enjoy this! for me, the unoriginality, lack of world building, lack of physical characteristics, writing, dialogue, etc., are what made this another disappointing read. if you enjoy this though, good for you!\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "3.75/5\n\nI didn't expect this book to receive such a high rating from me, but as it turns out, I liked it — I liked it a lot even. I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that's exactly what I got, so I'm satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that's what happens when you grow up with Wattpad.\n\nListen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections. You could look me straight in the eye and tell me that these books are cringe, stupid, predictable and that I can probably find better stories on Wattpad, and I would completely agree, but I would still simply read them, as they just have that something that works for me.\n\n\nBut, let’s move on to the point. My thoughts. Some spoilers also start here.\n\none If you were expecting another short heroine and a hero who would be twice her size, you will be disappointed. We finally have a tall couple.\n\n‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎\n\n\ntwo I really liked our heroine Misery. Yes, Ali did her dirty with that name and some of her fashion choices — the galaxy t-shirt, but it doesn't change the fact that I enjoyed her character. She definitely won't be added to my 'favorite heroines' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn't bad.\n\nthree The hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I'm talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that \"it was a mistake\" and \"she shouldn't be tied to someone like him\", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.\n\nStill, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about \"architect Alpha Werewolf\" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don't care.\n\n\n“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”\n\n\nfour The romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn't want to admit it, and a heroine who can't pick up any hint about it even though it's quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don't, but it was kind of hot.\n\nfive The plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery’s friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won't complain.\n\n\nThis was supposed to be a short review, but it didn't work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don’t be shy and add it to your tbr.\n\n\n————————\n\n\nVampires and werewolfs? I just know this man will be barking, growling and purring at her\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "That was surprisingly entertaining and actually good. I applaud Ali Hazelwood for taking a risk out of her comfort zone and writing this paranormal romance. She did not ruin werewolves and vampires for me after all 😌This change of writing and direction was majorly needed and it worked brilliantly. But tbf I had minimal expectations 🤷‍♀️\n\n✔️ Vampires + werewolves\n✔️ Marriage of convenience\n✔️ Slow burn\n\nThis one came pretty close to perfection. I liked the plot, characters and romance. The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing. Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure.\n\nThe characters are fun. Misery and Lowe are truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.\n\nThe side characters- Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!\n\nThe romance was pretty good. I devoured how Lowe and Misery were into each other. The slow burn was delicious. The spice not so much. Ali, listen to me bestie, in the most gentle way possible, babes, you cannot write smut 😭😭 I know you want to. But please for the love of God, stop writing smut. I wanna give you five stars but I can't until you stop knotting, and opening an Airbnb inside people's vaginas 😭😭\n\nOn a serious note, one thing that could have been better written was the mate storyline. It did not make sense. One moment Lowe wants her, the next he doesn't, then he does, then he doesn't, and then he does. Yeah, he clearly wanted her so why write it like that?! That deducted a star from me.\n\nOverall, it's pretty fun and worth trying. I adored the subtle Twilight references 🥰\n\n~•~•~\nAli, bestie.. you better not ruin werewolves or vampires for me or am out for revenge 😀😀😀\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "☆⋅⋆ ── 1st read 2023 (may): 5 stars\n☆⋅⋆ ─── 2nd read 2023 (nov): 5 stars\n\nSONG:\nThe Great War – Taylor Swift\n\n\nA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.\nA rider without their dragon is dead.\n\n\nhow did I miss the feeling of reading such a good book that I couldn’t wait to run to my notes app once I finished the book and write down a thesis dedicated to how awesome the book is. This is the best book that came out this year. THANK YOU FOURTH WING AND REBECCA FOR CURING MY READING AND REVIEWING SLUMP! 🙏 \n\nfirst of all while there are a lot of reason why I absolutely adored this book, I gave this book 5 stars, because while reading Fourth Wing I was reminded again why I love reading. While I still enjoyed reading in the last 2 years, most of the books I’ve read just felt so average and boring. Every plot, every character written, every love story felt predictable like I’ve read it a million times already. Reading Fourth Wing on the other hand felt refreshing and unique. I was on the edge of my seat every chapter wanting to know what would happen next and every time something great happened it made me giddy as hell like I’m 13 again reading Twilight/The Hunger Games in the middle of night just immersing myself in a new world. The stakes are fucking high in this book and no characters is safe. The two main characters are safe due to plot amor, but everyone else? Fuck around and find out. 🌚 \n\nlet’s start with a couple of selling points why everyone on planet earth and beyond HAS to give this book at least a try:\n\n➟ this book is set in a WAR COLLEGE. What does that mean? Imagine Harry Potter meets Zodiac Academy, but deadlier. Navarre is in a conflict with another country (don’t ask me to name it, the names in this books are insane but not in a good way 😭 I can’t remember shit) so because of the war that is going on, the student at Basgiath War College learn battle strategies, train for battle etc. and students die all the times there.\n\n➟ DRAGONS AND DRAGONRIDERS! I was always lowkey obsessed with books or shows that have dragons in it, but this book solified my obsession. Dragons actually can choose their riders and have magic how cool is that?! Once a dragon and a rider bonds, the rider can channel the dragon’s magic and it comes in all kind of forms. Someone could wield water, wind. Someone else can read memories through touching, Someone else can move objects. It’s fucking fantastic.\n\n➟ GREAT WORLD BUILDING. Besides the magic and dragons and all that which is amazing. The whole world of this universe is so interesting. The names and places in this world are complicated af, but the world building was explained great imo. Instead of a big info dumping we get the information easily through dialogues. I also thought it was quite endearing see Violet recite random history about Navarre when she is under stressful situation to calm herself down.\n\nThe 4 Quadrant groups at Basgiath War College are:\n\n✎ Riders Quadrant: the dragon riders and the ones that protect the country and fight against the enemies. They also have the best reputation in Naverre, because of how badass they are.\n\n✎ Healers Quadrant: are people who are the doctors and tend to all kind of injuries. There are also menders who are very rare who can mend broken bones quickly.\n\n✎ Scribe Quadrant: the academics and scholars of Navarre.. basically the brainiacs who know all about the history and all wars etc.\n\n✎ Infantry Quadrant: i’m honestly don’t know what they do.. i guess they are trained as soldier? idk really because we barely get informations about them and what they do..\n\n➟ SLOWBURN ENEMIES TO LOVERS ROMANCE. Violet and Xander are real enemies, since Violet’s mother killed Xanden’s father, but Xanderns father killed Violet’s brother!! so there is a lot of delicious tensions between them for a good reason. It takes them a while to open up, but when they do it’s explosive 🔥 so don’t worry there is smut and it’s very explicit you just have to be a little patient.\n\n➟ CHARACTERS ON POINT. The whole cast of this book is interesting. Not one single boring character in sight. Even the villains or bad characters in this book have a spark to them that will make you want to know more. Also all the relationship, friendship and alliances forged are great.\n\n➟ a very FAST PACED PLOT that will keep you on your toes. So much happens in this book I wouldn’t even know where to start summarizing it.\n\n➟ DRAGONS.. i can’t mentioned this enough. These dragons are ruthless and cunning and so badass I can’t stop talking about them. All of the dragons have their own personality. If you love House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones! This book is for you besties. ✨\n\n🗡️ VIOLET SORRENGAIL (h) 🗡️\n\n\n“I’m not going to die today.”\n\n\ndon’t we all root for the underdog and want to see them win?\n\neven tho I don’t think a perfect heroine exist, Violet makes an almost perfect fantasy heroine. She is the newest addition to my all time fav heroines that’s how awesome she is. 💅 \n\nAll her life she has been called weak and fragile due to ther size. She was trained to be a Scribe, but because her mother is an infamous Rider and doesn’t allowed for anything else beside being a Rider and boy did everyone underestimate Violet. It was so easy to root for Violet, because she never had it easy or choose the easy way out. What I always hate about fantasy heroine is that they are the chosen one and are always special in some kind of way or kickass from the beginning and that’s not Violet. She might fall into the chosen one/special trope, but she literally had to claw and fight her way to the top. Violet doesn’t have raw physical power, so every obsticle and challenged she had to use her wit, intelligence, will and sheer determination. Violet’s most powerful organ is her brain.\n\nAnother trait that I admire about Violet is her ✨compassion✨. The world, and especially Basgiath War College, is as cutthroat and ruthless as it can be. I fell in love with Violet the moment she decided to help a girl cross the parapet by asking her to switch one shoe with her since the other girl’s (Rhiannon) shoes were not made to cross that parapet, and she would have easily slipped and fallen to her death. Violet could have easily ignored that and let the competition take themselves out while making her climb simultaneously easier by having two good shoes, but that’s not how Violet is. How could I not root for her every step of the way? Impossible. My badass softie. 🥺\n\n🔹 XANDEN RIORSON (H) 🔹\n\ntall, broody, dark and handsome he embodies every typical fantasy hero to a T but who fucking cares it works, why change a running system?\n\nXanden is so hot. The most powerful wing leader at the college? Hell yes sign me up! The way he doesn’t care about rules and what everyone expects of him 🛐 but the hottest thing about Xanden is that he always believed in Violet’s potential. While everyone else around Violet always tries to baby her and protect her from harm, Xanden challenges her to be better and get stronger. I can also not forget what a comedian Xanden could be with his sarcasm.. it took me out sometimes because I didn’t see it coming lmao.\n\n\n“Have you always been this tall?” I blurt the first thing that comes to mind.\n”No. I was a child at some point.”\n\n\n\n\n\nXanden is tough on the outside and seems more broody than he already is, cause inside he is a lowkey softie. For the people he cares about he is loyal and would do anything for them and his friends would do anything for him as well. The loyalty is mutual. The found family y’all. 🥺👉👈\n\nSince the book is written solely from Violet’s POV there is so much about Xanden that intrigues me. He is still pretty much a mystery. There is so much about his past .. I’m looking at him and his mother’s relationship 👀 that needs to be uncovered. I want to know more about his relationship with his father as well since his father is the Great Betrayer who tried to rebel against Navarre’s king. There is so much potential to his backstory in book 2 and I can’t wait to find out more.\n\n🐉 TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS) 🐉\n\n\n“Violet Sorrengail ,” she says as she writes in the Book of Riders. “Nice to see that you made it.” She offers me a quick, shaky smile. “For the record, please tell me the name of the dragon who chose you.” I lift my chin. “Tairneanach.”\n“Pronunciation could use some work.” Tairn’s voice rumbles through my head.\n“Hey, at least I remembered ,” I think back in his general direction, wondering if he’ll hear me across the field.\n“At least I didn’t let you fall to your death.” He sounds utterly bored, but he definitely heard me.\n\nMy grumpy old dragon Tairn and my sunshine princess Andarna baby. 🥺😩 I have no words great enough to describe my love for these two dragons.\nThis big ass dragon bonding with this tiny human being will never cease to amaze me. You know we all love the grumpy hero, but give the heroine a grumpy dragon and that relatonship HITS DIFFERENT. Tairn and Violet’s relatonship is so funny .. all their banters had me grinning like a little kid it was so fun. 🖤\n\n🧚 THE ROMANCE 🧚\n\n\n“Am I affecting your schedule, Violence?” There’s a definite smirk on those lips. “I just need to know what my chances are here.” My hands curl into fists. The ass has the nerve to smile.\n“That’s the oddest way I’ve ever been hit on—”\n“Not my chances with you, you conceited prick!”\n\n\nfrom enemies to reluctant partners to lovers? Their development was so on point without being toxic. Both of them hated with hate for each other for valid reasons, but it never got toxic between them like a lot of real enemies to lovers in fantasy do.\n\n\nHe nips at my skin. “I’m not sweet. Please don’t mistake any part of me for soft or kind. That will only get you hurt, and whatever you do…” He buries his face in my neck, inhaling deeply. “Don’t fall for me.”\n\nVioletxander are the new standard for the “she fell first, but he fell harder” trope. Violet with her compassion can’t help but see the good in people, while it’s really hard for Xander to let anyone in let alone his mortal enemy. But his actions speak louder than his words. All the times he silently watches Violet, helped her, challenged her, trained her >>> I know he is obsessed with Violet even tho he is reluctant to admit his feelings for her.\n\n\n👫 SIDE CHARACTERS 👫\n\n\n“What did you want to be when you grew up?” I ask, just to keep the conversation going.\n”Alive.” He shrugs.\n\nLiam, Rhiannon, Imogen, Garrick and the rest. I love them all with and without their flaws.. some of them needed longer to grow and me then others, but eventually they all got me. They feel like family. 🙏\n\nI’d tell you to not get attached to them cause you don’t really now if they are making it until the end of the series or not, but honestly it’s not possible to not get attached to any of them. I’ll just be crying quietly in my corner when one of them eventually ends up dead bc of war and all. 😭\n\n👯‍♀️ VIOLET & MIRA 👯‍♀️\n\n\n“Don’t die, Violet. I’d hate to be an only child.” She grins and walks away, sauntering past the line of gawking candidates as word spreads of exactly who she is and what she’s done.\n\nMira the older protective sister who Violet had to live in the shadow all these years. While there weren’t that many scenes with Violet and Mira together.. I adored their scenes.\n\n💥 THE DEPICTION OF WAR 💥\n\nOne thing I liked a lot about Fourth Wing is how war is portrayed in this book. It might sound weird that I liked that a lot of people died in this book, but I thought that’s just realistic when it comes to war. Even the most efficient fighters in this book die not because they can’t protect themselves or fail in some kind of way, but some just do because they tried protecting their friends and some things don’t go their way. I never knew what would happen next and that was ✨ thrilling ✨.\n\nNothing is black and white as it seems and to see that realization from Violet slowly throughout the book was so interesting. She started the book firmly believing in one side (her mother being a war hero and all that) and to see her journey by the end of this book is quite fascinating. In war it always takes at least two to tango and neither side are 100% right or wrong..it’s just a matter of perspective.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor people who know me or have been following my reviews for some time, they know I’m the stingiest of reader and find fault in everything and get bored easily 😭 but this book got me hooked from the beginning and it only got better with each chapter. Was everything perfect no? I could always nitpick on some things, but as a whole? Fourth Wing is a fantasy masterpiece. The pace, the characters, the plot, the romance, did I mention THE DRAGONS??? *chef’s kiss*\n\nI’d like to add that the book ends on a cliffhanger, but it’s a “wow I can’t wait what will happen next” cliffhanger so it’s a good kind of cliffhanger not one where you want to flush the book down the nearest toilet. 😌 but anyways WAKE ME UP WHEN IT’S NOVEMBER 7th!!\n\n┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑\nTHE EMPYREAN SERIES\n\n#1 Fourth Wing – 5 stars\n#2 Iron Flame – tbr\n┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙\nShow more",

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW FAV BOOK FOREVER <3\n\nBut for everyone else who needs to know…\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the book:\nit’s about the daughter of a high-ranked general, Violet, getting ordered into learning how to become a dragon rider (but she doesn’t initially want to bc all she’s known are books her entire life) and so she commits to basgiath War collage where she goes through trials designed to root out the weak. She has to figure out how to best everyone and weaponise her strengths. While navigating her feelings for a certain forbidden boi. There’s romance AND (back arching) spice with sparks and tension galore. Also for everyone wondering, the ending isn’t that bad. It’s more of a promising cliffhanger. Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao.\n\n*\nI’m sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus *wags brows* do you see what I did there?\nIt’s been ages since I’ve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone 🙏\n\nThis book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-\n\nAND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER- There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren’t the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they’re almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It’s fast-paced and that’s something I ADORE about this book.\n\nBUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS?? The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermore 😩❤️‍🩹\nThe dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact 🤭💗🦋 they’re both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm. I’m telling you this book never left me wanting for anything. There was never a time when I was like ugh the MCs hardly interact or wtv. There’s a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I’ll never be able to get over it.\n\nWhile reading, it leaves you feeling as though you’ve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself 😤🔪 I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive 🙏\n\nViolet is me. I am Violet. We are one.\nNo bc she is the most relatable character I’ve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She’s not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn’t afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There’s no ‘my body is betraying me’ bullshit. Not in this house. I’m in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she’s owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ✨💗🦋🤌\nWatching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.\nThere wasn’t a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She’s strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger.\n\nXADEN is such a seductive menace but he’s MY precious seductive menace.\nHe's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He’s such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better?? It’s the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me 🥹💗🙏😩🦋💞✨🧸\n\nI’m always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares 🤭\ntheir not so short glances across the classroom 💞\nhis sarcastic quips 💅\nhim being a brooding surly grump😩\nhim being lethally calm 👑\nhim obsessed with her every move 🙏💗\nHim telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint?? 🤌❤️‍🔥 (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-\nThe way I fell for him the first moment he was described?? Everyone is saying how he’s like this guy or that guy from this book and that and I’m just here like idc if he was an amalgamation of every MMC I love?? I DONT CARE BECAUSE IT MADE ME LOVE HIM EVEN MORE 👏 I respect Rebecca for plucking the best traits of every fantasy MMC, like don’t be shy put some more 💀✋\n\nAnd there are the dragons but all you need to know is that each one has their personality. They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss*\n\nThe found family in this book is the most precious thing ever. I loved to read how they’re bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books 😩\n\nOkay SPOILERS ahead!! bc your girl gotta scream <33\n-\n-\n-\n\nWhen Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I’m still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING. LOUD.\nAnd then Andarna was like “TELL HER MY NAME AS WELL” and I’m- *passes out from yelling so much*\n\nI LOVE ANDARNA SFMMM SHES THE MOST ADORABLE CUTE LITTLE SUNSHINE IVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT 🥹🫂💗😫💞🧸 The light of my life I’m telling you. she must be protected at all costs. (But omg at the end Xaden was like Goldie’s gone huge and I’m here like oop- I NEED TO SEE HER RFN)\n\nI love how Tairn is a dad adjacent to Violet 🙏 he’s my grumpiest overprotective pookie 🤭💗with STRONG feelings for his mate skskdhjd (I’m kinda jelly of Sgaeyl ngl)\n\nALSO HOW FUCKING DARE YOU REBECCA!! You ripped my heart out of my chest, gave it a thousand paper cuts and flung it into a volcano for good measure. Liam's death BROKE me🔪 I cried too many fat ugly tears 😭 it was unbearable *shaky breath* but when XADEN found out and cried the cry of all cries?!? Me: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) X 100\n\nAnd the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he’ll be part of the “wrong” side of the war and it’s been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*\n\nAnd Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him. He’s basically Adam from shatter me, and fml bc my reread is just gonna be me wanting to rip his spine out and strangling him w it whenever he speaks 😃🔫\nBut when that inntinnsic called his every thought out to the crowd it was the most hilarious shit ever pls 💀 he’s so pathetic.\n\nSPOILERS OVER\n\nOne thing I have to say is that this book is not perfect. The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I’ll take it, faults and all. After all, I’m a character development lover so I can overlook it.\n\nBUT THE WORLD BUILDING IS- ヽ(♡‿♡)ノOml the way this author writes leaves you ON THE EDGE WHITE KNUCKLING YOUR SEAT GASPING SHAKING SCREAMING bc you have no idea what will happen next.\n\nIT'S THE BIGGEST FLEX TO NOT ONLY OUTDO THE OGS BUT TO EXCEL PHENOMENALLYYYYY AT IT AS WELL 💅✨ REBECCA YAROS YOU ARE AN ICON BC I GOBBLED UP EVERY SCENE EVERY CHAPTER EVERY WORD.\n\n𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:\nI think it’s become my favourite fantasy book ever.

        "Review 3": "5 stars 🐉\n\nThis book is a rollercoaster of twists and had me so hooked from the start! Not once did it feel boring or like I should just skim something, and for once, I know the hype was so worth it! 😩\n\n• Spoilers ahead — and I seriously want y'all to enjoy this book without spoilers\n\nThis book is the perfect blend of Fantasy-Romance because it had the spiciest romance scenes with lots of sexual tension and enough twists that will keep you awake the whole night. *Dark circles forming, but anything for XadenVi.*\n\n\n❝The weak don’t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant. The dragons make sure of that.❞\n\n\nIn the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider's Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons. This is in contrast to Violet's original plan of following her father's path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn't mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive.\n\n╰┈➤ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:\n\n\n❝You look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞\n\n\nDespite dealing with a chronic illness (ehler's danlos syndrome) and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away. Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider's quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions—fear, anger, desire, happiness—kept me amazed. Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn't even get that 'oh I'm so tiny and frail' or the 'pick me vibes' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness.\n\nI would've dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet's situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me! It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet's intelligence that kept her alive! And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! 🤭\n\n\n❝What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.❞\n— She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.\n\n╰┈➤ XADEN RIORSON:\n\n\n❝Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.❞\n\n\nFantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW 🥵, he exudes both danger and allure. His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn't known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him. fuck Dain. Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade. However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It's this side of him that I adore. 💞\n\nHe holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don't even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks – it leaves me utterly on my knees for him! 🧎‍♀️His character possesses incredible depth, and I would've loved to have his POV.\n\nHe's a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar — I feel something inside of me! 😮‍💨 REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! 🤭\n\n— Ruthless who? He's such a softie....\n\n🔪 gave Violet training for sparring matches.\n🔪 made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.\n🔪 made a custom dagger for her.\n🔪 killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.\n🔪 took care of her when she was hurt.\n🔪 punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.\n\n╰┈➤ DRAGONS:\n\n— So the most sarcastic person creature award goes to TAIRN! 🫡\n\nGod, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! 🤭 His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden. Hehehe, and he also adores Sgaeyl sm! If he were actually a human, he'd be so grumpy and possessive, I'M TELLING YA'LL! 😂💕\n\n\n❝And to think, I’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.❞\n\n\nAndarna: This cutie goldie dragon—OMF, she was such a cutie! I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she's also bonded with Violet 🥺\n\nSgaeyl: We didn't get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I'm so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. 🥵\n\n— ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*\n\n\n❝He’s a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.❞\n\n\nXaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion. These children were forcibly placed into the Rider's Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet's mother), so they're enemies, and he's the one who's gonna kill handle her. 🤭\n\nThe enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done. It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that 'children shouldn't be punished for their parents' mistakes.' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet's relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts. Even though they weren't enemies for very long, the book didn't rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ♥️\n\nViolet was super confused by Xaden's behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. 😉\n\n\n❝Going for blood today, are we, Violence?❞\n\n\nAfter Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden's dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn't consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) 🥹\n\nTHE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING. 🥵 The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! 🫣🔥\n\n\n❝I am annoyingly aware of everything you do.❞\n\n\nNOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ✨IT✨.\n\n╰┈➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:\n\nRhiannon and Rodic: They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! 🥺 Am I the only one who wants them together? Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.\n\nSawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton: I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!\n\nMira Sorrengail: This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! 🥵 She's so fierce and the best sister ever! 💞\n\nLiam Mairi: WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. 🥺😭 I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I'm never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.\n\nDain Aetos: This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off?? I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using 'best friend' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her. IF HE DIDN'T READ VIOLET'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! 🤢\n\n\n❝Stop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.❞\n— yeah, bitch, get that!\n\nJack Barlowe: He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I'm glad he was Violet's first kill, haha served him right! I don't want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying 😗🤝🏻\n\nLong-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.\n\nGeneral Sorrengail: I dislike her already and I know I'll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.\n\nSyrena (Flier): She's a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!\n\n— some other things:\n\n1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move! It's truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.\n\n2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I'm just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)\n\n3. All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day! Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. 🤧\n\n4. \"Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” — these beautiful words!!?? 🤭\n\n5. I seriously don't even understand how Violet blocked the pain out and got so many stitches every month! I'd already be on my deathbed 😂\n\n6. Am I the only one who couldn't — even after reading 3 times — imagine the GAUNTLET scene???? like WTH WAS THAT 😭\n\n7. MY TOXIC TRAIT IS THAT I THINK I WOULD'VE KILLED THE VENIN IF I WERE IN VIOLET'S PLACE (wth? 💀💀)\n\n8. I had doubts about Venins and Wyvern from the start, and gosh, they were horrifying AF! If we want anything to be real, IT'S FICTIONAL MEN, not these ew!\n\n9. GOD, THE END? I'm still shocked 🥲\n\nwhjwhsha, I love this book!

        "Review 4": "Edit: for those who do not read the whole review but still feel they are entitled to leave a comment. This is a long review\n1- it dissects a lot in the book, if this is not a clue for you that there are spoilers then maybe check your IQ.\n2- For those who are saying \"make it short\" you know you could scrol by and not read right? just take your own advice especially if you love this book and move along to the millions of 5 star reviews\n3- STOP SAYING NOTHING IS ORIGINAL..I can slap you with at least 20 books written in 2923/2024 that has more originality than this book! We are not asking for a Tolkein level of originality, but if you cannot even come up with your own character description and had to take the literal description from other books (among others) then why are you even called an author?\n\n4- in a world that is coming soon to be drowned with AI movies and clips and pictures, I do not want to read an AI book. and I do not mean that the author used AI (Although at this point no one knows), I mean the copy, paste, and stitch from other books\n\nother than that, knock yourself out\n\n\nThe sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elements\nIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is 😡😡😡😡\nevery time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it's not!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE END\n\nIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!\nby now, this has become a game of \"SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE\"\nthis book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters' descriptions are literally taken\n\nPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE IT\nAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???\n\nIt is one thing to sample an idea or concept from \"a book\", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from \"a book\" or in this case \"books\" and make it your own.\n\nThis book is a memory quilt\nMade from old stuff to look new\nIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoyment\n\nLet's imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn't\nread and loved the other books mentioned down 👇🏻 I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.\nAnd surprise surprise! This is what is happening\n\nbut ignorance is not an excuse! Just because you haven't read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!\n\nstarting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr. the lingo itself was so cringe\nimage:\n\n\nI read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this book\nread Ageless and Warda's one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrong\n\n\nThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can’t be cunning, it's her life on the line. “I’ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later”\n\nbut, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical \"I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything\". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like “Pick me, choose me, love me, fuck me”. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has \"Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans\"\n\nand let’s not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn’t love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winner\n\n\nBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to death\n\nI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.\n\nAnd the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that's been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I'll shut up about it\n\nA dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without their dragon is dead.\n\nWhy? Why is it this way?\n\nHowever, there is a big issue that is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.\n\nTHIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISE\n\nWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: \"This book scratches an itch\nand boy! did this strategy work!\n\nThis did not sit well with me because :\n\nOne: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.\n\nTwo: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literal\n\nThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it's own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did not\n\nWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)\n\n\nSo lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)\n\nLet me begin with the main characters description\n\n\n\n\nNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning power\nAnd the whole \"assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion\"\nYeah\nIt's like FW has this weird fixation on this series\n\nbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?\n\n\n\n\n\nand how about this one?\n\n\n\nno this is not Xaden Riorson\n\nthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)\nor the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow hands\n\nBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!\nMeadows baby! Our last name is Meadows\n\nNo!? OK, here's another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with \"are you for real?!\"\n\nNow, here's a trivia for you\nLet's count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lightening\nJust off the top of my head\nRed Queen\nShadow and Bones\nThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.\n\nNow the plotline\n\n1- Harry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but “the cadets are thrown into “four wings” upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining “points” and showing skills both physically and mentally. . The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a “tournament” where they had to “retrieve a stolen treasure” to “earn 60 points”\n\n2- Divergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don’t want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!\nAnd the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on\n\n\n\n3- The Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games – Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet’s neck infront of others. I guess “the odds are always stacked against them” yep! This was in the book!\n\n\n\nAnd since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses 🙄🙄\n\n4- Shatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.\n\n5- Throne of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these “hands” and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan’s passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X\n\n\n\n6- Mulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.\n\n\n\n7- How to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this book\n\n\n\nBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES\n\n8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of Thrones\nSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!\n\n\npeople inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator dies\nimage:\n\n\nAnd the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braid🙄and thought at first to be fragile and weak!\n\n9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffery\nEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing\n\n10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?\n\n\n\nBonus courtesy of @Soyas.Readingpalace\n\nThis is the map of the Fourth Wing\n\n\n\nThis is the map of the Witcher books\n\n\n\nnotice anything?\n\nThis piece of jem has been gracely sent to me through messages by Filip with the keen eye\nHere is exactly what Filip said\n\"\"I know I am late to the party, but just started Iron Flame and couldn't not notice one more similarity. If you look at the map of Hogwarts from the films and take away The library with Bell towers, Astronomy tower, and Viaduct entrance, rotate The Great Hall by 30° you get... Basgiath. The castle stands on two cliffs which are home to the two parts of the castle. Between them, a gorge, above which 2 bridges are spanning - the one on the right being the more solid one, the one on the left more thin one. Southern part of the castle has a Castel type, with four palaces arranged into square, surrounded by four towers. The tower on the bottom right is a home to Gen. Sorrengail - being the same spot where Albus Dumbledore's office is. .....\"\"\n\nSo I'll put the two maps and all you have to do is rotate Hogwarts map and viola= Basgiath\n\nHogwarts\n\n\n\nBasgiath\n\n\n\nso, there is nothing original about this book\nYou want to take the characters' descriptions? fine\noh, you want to take also the plot conflict? fine\nwhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?\nBUT\nWhat are you bringing to the table then?????\n\nI think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn’t read the above-mentioned books or doesn’t want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them. If you are this person, then this book is perfect for you\nHowever, I am a reader who values authenticity not imitation done blatantly. There was no originality in either the story or the plotline\n\nThese are some TT posting similarities with pages and story👇🏻\n\npages from the book\n\nfourth wing and GoT\n\nhow FW was writtent\n\nimportant note\nI was one of the first who read this book upon release. if you check the tiktoks I've put, you'll see that the first one was made May 15 2023, same week.\nSince then, I've answered so many questions in my TT account and here, and a lot of them are so repeated\nSo, please, if you read this review, and find yourself wanting to comment with:\n1- nothing is original\n2- read for fun\n3- do your research\n4- it's not that serious\n5- why are you taking the joy out of others\nI urge you to read the comments first because I won't be repeating myself for your lack of effort.\nWhat I am willing and happy to do, is have a respectful discussion.

i’ll tell you what. it’s this book. besties let me just start with saying…i am a romance/dark romance girly through and through. the only other fantasy books i’ve ever read were the acotar books and that series was so good. easily one of my favorite series ever, but fourth wing? it was even better…literal chefs kiss🤌i was hooked from the very first sentence to the very last. i’ve read one of rebecca’s romance books and i loved it, but her writing fantasy?! she ate that up and left zero crumbs. this is easily one of my top reads of 2023. fourth wing was action packed and the romance was amazing.\n\n❥ 𝓉𝓇𝑜𝓅𝑒𝓈:\n⤷ found family\n⤷ enemies to lovers\n⤷ slow burn\n⤷ touch her and you die\n⤷ morally grey mmc\n⤷ forced proximity\n\n❥ 𝒶𝑒𝓈𝓉𝒽𝑒𝓉𝒾𝒸:\n⤷ dragons\n⤷ academic setting\n⤷ divergent vibes\n⤷ dystopian fantasy\n\n❥ 𝓅𝓁𝑜𝓉 𝓈𝓊𝓂𝓂𝒶𝓇𝓎:\nthis book is about violet sorrengail, the daughter of a high ranked general. most of her life she was practicing/training to be apart of the scribe quadrant because of her love for books and her intelligence, but her mother told her that she must follow in her siblings footsteps and become a dragon rider. violet is in no way prepared for that, but she ends up going to basgiath war college to do exactly what her mother asked of her. to become a dragon rider, you must pass all these very deadly challenges that are designed to kill off the weak. while violet is trying her very best to become a dragon rider…she‘s constantly fighting her attraction for xaden riorson (her enemy that she was told to stay away from). xaden is a well respected wingleader of the fourth wing and his one goal was to kill violet because of the family she belongs to, but what happens when her life suddenly becomes tethered to his?\n\n❥ 𝓂𝓎 𝓉𝒽𝑜𝓊𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈:\nthis book was so easy to follow and it was so fast paced. i was a little intimidated because the font was small and the chapters were longer than i usually prefer, but there was not a single page in this book that was boring. i’m usually the type to see how many pages are left in a chapter, but i simply did not care. i was fully consumed by this book and got totally lost in it. the action…it caused me a LOT of anxiety, but i ate that shit up. this book had my heart RACING. there were so many parts in this book that literally took my breath away…had me forgetting how to breathe. the romance!?! ♾️/10. the angst, the spice, the banter…literally everything you want for a romance plot. the writing was absolutely amazing. the descriptive writing omg…10/10. it was so easy to picture all of the different settings and picture everything that was happening. i felt like i was sitting in the front row watching this entire book unfold. this book has so much potential to be turned into a movie omg please😭cast theo james as xaden IMMEDIATELY and then cast me as violet🤭and then let’s just erase dain completely. i adored most of the characters in this book. i love when i fall in love with side characters just as much as main characters.\n\n°❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･･:*.ೃ࿔⋆❀°\n\n❥ 𝓋𝒾𝑜𝓁𝑒𝓉 𝓈𝑜𝓇𝓇𝑒𝓃𝑔𝒶𝒾𝓁 (𝓋𝒾𝑜𝓁𝑒𝓃𝒸𝑒):\n\n⁀➷ ❝i am the sky and the power of every storm that has ever been. i am infinite.❞\n\n⁀➷ ❝i will not die today.❞\n\nthis woman. one of my all time favorite fmc’s who i admire so much. her character development was phenomenal. i swear it was the most satisfying thing about this book. as soon as she was painted to be this tiny, weak, helpless woman…i was impatiently waiting for my girl to prove everyone wrong and she DID that. i love how well she knew her own mind and was not afraid to come forward and speak it. a place like the riders quadrant is where people go and get stripped of their humanity, but i love how violet kept all her morals intact. she knows who she is and y’all she is THAT bitch. the way she had so many people wanting/trying to kill her, but she never lost sight of who she was so when it came to her having a perfect chance to end the lives of those who wanted to end hers…she didn’t want to do it. it’s not her. ahhh i just love her so much.\n\n❥ 𝓍𝒶𝒹𝑒𝓃 𝓇𝒾𝑜𝓇𝓈𝑜𝓃 (𝒽𝓊𝓈𝒷𝒶𝓃𝒹):\n\n⁀➷ ❝fascinating. you look all frail and breakable, but you’re a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞\n\nimmediately theo james. that is who he reminds me of. but then THE FANART!?! was not prepared😩xaden is a man you steer clear from and because he’s that kinda man…sign me and violet the fuck up cuz we’re THERE…on our knees. he’s the type of man that raises your pulse because of fear or lust…there’s no in between. xaden has so many walls up and throughout the book, violet tears those down…one by one. i loved xaden’s character from the start which is crazy to say because he made it very clear that he wanted to kill violet. but just know this… behind every villain is me falling in love with them.\n\n⁀➷ ❝i might be a villain to some, but not you.❞\n\nthis man could literally run me over with his dragon and i’d still chase after him. i love his leadership and it meant so much more to me after finding out about his past. this man deserves the world. i love how protective he is and how he always challenged violet to do better and get stronger.

        "Review 6": "5 ⭐️ If Throne of Glass, Divergent, Eragon, and Zodiac Academy had a baby. . . but this is better!!!\n\n*PS: I don't really even like ZA, but it's similar because of the academic setting, the heroine's journey to understanding her strength, and the enemies-to-lovers aspect (it's not quite a bully romance though).\n\nYou know when you finish a book, and it leaves an ache in your chest because it was so good, and now it’s over? Yeah, that’s exactly how I feel after finishing Fourth Wing.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThere are only two ways to leave Basgiath War College: graduate or die. ⁠\n⁠\nViolet was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant and live a quiet life among books. However, when her mother, the commanding general, forces her to join the Riders Quadrants to become a dragon rider, she must push herself past all limitations in order to survive. ⁠\n⁠\nStaying alive would be a lot easier if Violet didn't have a target on her back for not only being 'small and frail' but the daughter of the woman responsible for the deaths of many cadet's traitorous parents, including Xaden Riorson's - the most powerful and ruthless wingleader. She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. ⁠\n⁠\nWith stakes this high, every day could be her last. So Violet must learn to do the one thing she was never trained to do: fight. ⁠\n\n\"I will not die today.\" -Violet Sorrengail\n⁠\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n✨ adult romantasy\n✨ true enemies to lovers\n✨ war college setting\n✨ dragon riders\n✨ magic\n✨ underdog fmc / chronic illness rep\n✨ scarred anti-hero mmc\n✨ unique world building\n✨ complex politics\n✨ found family\n✨ high stakes\n✨ insta-lust with slow burn\n✨ 2/5 🌶️ (2 explicit spicy scenes)\n✨ cliffhanger ending\n\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI am utterly obsessed! Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!\n\nThe writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! ⁠\n\nViolet Sorrengail is a secret badass! I LOVE her!!!!! She’s a twenty-year-old bookworm who’s expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she’s smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn’t make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She’s extremely relatable, and I can’t wait to see how she grows.\n\nXaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time! The son of a traitor, he’s out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father's death. From a distance, he’s a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he’s a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet….damn. You truly don’t know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it’s hot! The things I would let this man do to me. 🥵\n\nThe enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice! I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it’s explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.\n\nThe dragons stole my heart. I don’t want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don’t see much of since they’re very secretive, but it’s fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can't wait to learn more about them in the next book!\n\nThe found family aspect was done so well! As a dragon rider, you're encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! 💕\n\nThe world building so easy to understand yet very interesting. I’ve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it's so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don’t know if I’d survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!\n\nPS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you’re going to fall in love with this world!!!\n\nFor the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it’s all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading! I mean, we've seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.\n\nHOWEVER . . .\n\nThat ENDING was everything I was not expecting! Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It's a cliffhanger, but it'll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don't be afraid of it! It's brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don't have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!\n\n\nBut with everything I love, there are a few things I didn't like . . .\n\nSometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature. She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.\n\nThe reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet. It’s quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like “I can’t stay away from you”or “you’ll be the f*cking death of me”. Every time he's say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!\n\n\nOverall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn’t say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it’s closer to 4.5 since it wasn’t ‘perfect’, but honestly, I don't care. I haven’t read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I'm giving it all the stars.\n\nThank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

        "Review 7": "this review will contain spoilers\n\nDo you remember when you were 10 and you were left alone playing in your backyard, talking to yourself, and in the little roleplay in your mind you were the coolest, hottest, bravest and everyone around you thought you were impressive, badass , with a \"mind sexy as hell\" (quote from this book)and you blew everyone's minds because you can be as cool as you want to inside your own head?\n\nYeah, this is what this book reads like. I can't humanely comprehend how this has a higher rating than Six of Crows. I just can't. Here are the things I agree with that everyone has been saying:\n\nGood idea, fucking awful, god awful execution. And a little bit of a Shadow and Bone rip off if you ask me.\n\nShe is supposed to be a scribe. She is forced to become a rider, she gets there, her childhood best friends who has always had feelings for her is mad that she is there, and worried that she won't survive. But don't worry, because the SHADOW WIELDER bad boy who hates her is there to train her and teach her all about that world. Oh and by the end she ends up being a LIGHTENING WIELDER. There hasn't been one in centuries.\n\nMay the sun summoner bless you Fourth Wing, you're about to get roasted.\n\nLet's get the disability rep talk out of the way, many people told me there was some. And even if there is, the author approached the subject so so so subtlely I honestly couldn't even tell it was there. Because the only thing that was actually written was: I am so tiny, I am so weak, I am so fragile, frail, I will crumble. Please, don't send me to the dragon riding academy, because I am ramen noodle and I will break and die. Have I also mentioned I am white, pale, and very very very very thin? By the way, I am tiny. I am so smoll. I can't even jump on the dragon's back I am so small.\n\nHow will she ever survive?\n\nI feel like for people who don’t know that specific disability, she doesn’t give you any insight? Like what does it mean? How does it happen? What is it called? As someone who had never heard of it before it was hard to even notice when she was talking about the disability. It didn’t bring any kind of awareness (which I’d think would be the whole point) Also someone who is this breakable can’t be having wild fucking sex but apparently we forgot about her disability during the sex scenes lmao. But it doesn’t matter because no matter what, everyone wanted to kill her and THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD EVER SURVIVE\n\nIn this place where apparently people die daily, like flies. So much danger, so much death, so much struggle. That you don't see. You just hear about it because the author got too lazy to actually do any world building. So for the first half of the book there is just a bunch of telling and no showing.\n\nBut don't worry, this frail, little pale, white girl, with white hair will bond not ONE BUT TWO of the rarest most powerful dragons alive. Even if she's not even tall enough to jump on their back.\n\nAlso, enemies to lovers? Where? Where the fuck was that? These two have less chemistry than a priest with a hooker. Her mom is responsible for the death of someone in his family, so he blames her, he wants to kill her, he hates her from the momen the sees her (it lasts about two pages). But every time SHE SEES him, all she can think of is: \"He's a shark and everyone next to him is a fish\", Dammit I don't want to find this asshole hot, but he's so hot\", \" \"omg, he calls me violence intead of violet, I am not attracted to toxic men but why do I want to bounce on his dick sooooooooooo bad...\"\n\nSo she basically sounds like a 14 year old valley girl for the entire book.\n\nThey barely have any significant encounters, all of their interactions are so cringe that it makes me think this book should have been published in 2001. He smells like citrus, he has 107 scars on his back. And he tells her she's going to be the death of him every time he gets a chance.\n\n\"He's a very dangerous addiction. Something women will kill for. \"\n\nIf you catch me killing for men, please, end me first.\n\nAnyways, of course we have the most recycled sex dialogue on the plannet.\n\nOH GODS - WHICH GOD ARE YOU CALLING OUT FOR ITS JUST ME HERE AND I DONT SHARE\n\nThey fall deeply in love with each other, even though they barely interacted throughout the book, barely created a connection and didn't even hate each other at all for longer than a couple of pages. She bonds with the most powerful dragons alive, one of her dragons is mated to HIS DRAGON, and every time the dragons get horny SO DO THEY. So they have to learn how to control the hornyness coming from the dragons wanting to fuck. I wish I was joking.\n\nThe book ends with a very predictable cliffhanger (which is a rip off from Red Queen and Divergent) and now this is one of the best selling books in the world.\n\nWatchu gonna do.\n\nI guess there is something out there for everyone. Part of me thinks that most people got paid really well to love this book so much. But that would be disingenuous of me to say, because I know people who didn't get paid who enjoyed it. So I guess I can see that this book might feel nostalgic.\n\nIt gives you all the 2001 writing cringe fest, so if you missed reading something like Twilight, you'll definitely have fun. The characters are as childish as Zodiac Academy characters, so if you enjoy that, you might have a good time. She steals elements from Harry Potter, Shadow and Bone (most of the plot actually) ACOTAR, and used the writing style and sex scene lines most booktok people love, so BOOM! Best-Seller.\n\nAnyways, I am finally fucking free. I think I have learned my lesson and I willl chill on the booktok recommendations for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.\n\nShe just \"borrowed\" SO FREAKING MUCH from many other popular series that this feels so unoriginal. It almost feels like she threw this book into an AI and said: write me a YA novel and the AI grabbed all the most popular series and put it in there. The sex scenes are all repetitive and recycled. It reads like YA, but it has none of the good aspects from YA, there’s too much sexual content that adds nothing to the plot (and this is supposed to be a fantasy series) So yeah, it's a no from me. Too bad as well because the dragons were cool.\n\nUPDATE: I was literally going through my old Throne of Glass highlights and found ANOTHER series this author ripped off. Aelin says she wakes up everyday and tells herself she will not be afraid. Guess who does that too in this series? 🤣\n\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "”there is no me without you.”\n\n\nI. NEED. THE. NEXT. BOOK. NOW. 🗣️\n\n— i cannot gather my thoughts and get my points out coherently rn — like how can i even write this review and explain how much i loved this book - i swear this book had me in the biggest fkn chokehold 2 chapters in!! I. AM. OBSESSED. WITH. THIS. BOOK. fourth wing had a great mixture between romance and high stakes, this story was giving me major divergent and the hunger games vibes like when i tell you the vibes where there, THEY WERE THERE. it had everything i loved (and dragons) - i haven’t felt this excited about a fantasy book in MONTHS but this was captivating and now i feel a reading slump coming bc of it lmao rip to me. this is a book that is really easy to get into, it’s very fast paced and was engaging right from the beginning to the very end, I WAS HOOKED!! this lives up to the massive hype it’s getting, i get it now.. i could have read this in a day, but i needed to slow it down and savour this book.\n\n➳ i found the fantasy and world building easy to understand (there are no dumb info dumps) - so this book is perfect for those who are new to reading fantasy; yarros takes what most other books only manage to allude to and truly brings depth to her story which brings it to life. i got hooked with the whole fantasy war school, quadrants and politics setting. this is a book i want to live in, i want to jump into the pages and never leave!!\n\n➳ i understand now when people say it was very predictable bc i guessed that ending from page 1 - however, i would much rather have a predictable book than one that makes no sense bc it is trying to confuse the reader w so much unnecessary shit added into it. this was done in a perfect way.\n\n\n”you look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”\n\n\n↳ violet is probably one of the most incredible FMCs i have read about in a while. i loved her tight bond w her sister, her dragons and the love she has for books. she’s tough, very strong willed, quick witted and not afraid to go the extra mile to succeed. she works through each challenge that is thrown at her by using her strengths and knowledge, and proves she belongs just like everyone else. i loved reading about her journey, seeing her exceed all expectations and break down every barrier she succumbed.\n— there is an disability representation with the fmc (she has a chronic illness) and the author done an amazing job at showing how her chronic illness doesn’t define her. i love how she shows everyone she is not some frail weakling that constantly needs to be protected. *cough* dain *cough*\n\n↳ xaden is first introduced as the most powerful wing leader violet is warned to STAY AWAY from. violet had this superstition that he is out to kill her bc her mother had his father executed. but from the get go, we all know as an audience he doesn’t want to kill her, he was so smitten for violet right from the start. that man had weapons custom made for violet that would fit her body type, built a harness for andarna that clips onto tairn just so she could ride along with them and also literally made a saddle for violet to use on tairn so she doesn’t fall off while riding!! i can’t explain how much i love this man and his grumpy exterior but deep down he’s a big softy for those he loves. I JUST LOVE MEN WHO SHOW THEIR LOVE THROUGH ACTIONS!!\n— i will take no slander on him EVER. he is that typical broody, morally grey love interest ppl roll their eyes over, but he has DEPTH. this man fr had me kicking my feet in the air, giggling and screaming into my pillow whenever he would call violet “violence” 🤭 he is exactly what vi needed!! i just love how he always believed in her and only wants to see her at her full potential and succeed.\n\nthe romance: oh my goddd, the romance was perfect!! 😮‍💨🤌🏼 the slow burn? was burning, absolutely delicious. enemies to lovers? SPLENDID, BEAUTIFUL, EXECUTED PERFECTLY. i was itching for xaden and vi sm. the spice? DELECTABLE. TOE CURLING. the enemies aspect of this book was so satisfying, istg it had me going feral !! the tension was EVERYTHING. it's the perfect build up and the pay off is amazing once it happens.\n\n↳ dain is another adam kent loser side hoe. he acts like vi is some fragile little girl that needs constant protection, tells her to leave bc he wanted her to be a scribe like she was intended to be not a dragon rider and hides her away. he was constantly holding her back and questions her ability at every turn,, PLS HE IS ADAM KENT CODED. and the sort of love triangle was very juliette, adam and warner literally cut the mf cameras. his death arc when?? next book im praying.\n\n↳ tairn and andarna - they were the best addition to this book!! yarros done an incredible job with providing so much details about the dragons, their history and their personalities - i absolutely loved the interactions between the dragons and their riders - i fkn love tairn my grump, i adored his protectiveness over violet and would not even think twice about burning you alive if you hurt or touch her, yes xaden included lmaoo. he was so snarky it had me giggling w how sassy and unbothered he was. and i love how tairn and sgaeyl were a mated pair bc it ended up making violet and xaden tethered heh 🤭\n\n\n“there’s no where in existence you\ncould go that i wouldn’t find you, violence”\n\n\n— okay but i could enthuse ab every little detail of this book, but this is one of those stories that you NEED to read. you don't just read a book like this, you live in it and never want to return, specially bc in this world xaden exists and you get to ride dragons.\n\nthis isn’t a perfect book there are some flaws, but this was perfect to me! like yes it is super predictable, yes it’s tropey, but am i obsessed? YES, YES I AM. it had everything i wanted in a fantasy book and so many dragons. this story will be something different to everyone, you’re either going to love or hate it, but you need to read this at least once in your life. but ahh i can’t wait to get my greedy little hands on iron flame, i needed that book in my hands yesterday.\n\nthank you amelie & hannah for br w me!! 🩷✨\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "1.5/5\n\nNew half-year resolution—I need to stop taking recommendations from Booktok.\n\nI’m not gonna to lie here, if this series hadn't been raved about everywhere I looked online, I probably wouldn't have read it. I’m trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first book by Rebecca Yarros, so I didn't know what exactly to expect, but at least now I know that it will be my first and last story by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.\n\nThis review probably won't cover all the things I didn't like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book. But without further ado, let's finally get to the point of my review—what exactly didn't work out for me in this story.\n\nThe story didn’t hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn't speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, because of that reason, but decided to give it another chance because I thought it might not be my day for it or maybe I wasn't in the right mood after a whole week. At one point I was even glad about this decision, but my enthusiasm didn’t last long. I have to be honest and say that around forty percent of the book I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally showed up. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.\n\nThe second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. I must admit that Violet had some great moments, but most of the time I was just embarrassed by her actions. The example.\n\n\n“Glad to see our year apart hasn’t dulled your tongue, Vi.”\n“Oh,” I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, “I can do quite a few things with my tongue. You’d be impressed.”\n\n\nThat line sounded like a horny frat boy.\n\nAlso, if you didn’t get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.\n\n\n\"I’m too short.\"\n\n“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down\"\n\n\"Good gods, I don’t even reach his collarbone.\"\n\n\"I’m shorter than most.\"\n\n“You’re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.”\n\n\"I’m at a disadvantage, that I’m too small to climb its foreleg and mount,\"\n\n“You’re tiny.” He says it like an insult\"\n\n\"I’m the smallest of our squad\"\n\n“I’m too short for the ramp,” I whisper to Rhi.\"\n\n“I’m too short to span the distance!” I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.\"\n\n\n‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎\n\n\nThat's only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of my review.\n\nMoving to Xaden—aka, your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot, he was\n\n\n\"Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.\"\n\n\nyou get the picture. He was also tall. I've written about it before, but we've also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.\n\n\n\"You have incredibly touchable skin.”\n\n\nTouchable skin? What does it mean buddy?\n\nHonestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I'd probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.\n\nThe last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love—probably because I didn't make it to this part, and have a strong connection—again, probably because I didn't make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like \"Well, that’s it? Already?\". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers, the reasoning behind it made even sense, but they delivered nothing. I felt no chemistry between them, no tension, especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.\n\n\n\"I hate him so much\"\n\n\n‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎\n\n\n\n\"But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy. And tall.\"\n\n\nNot even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out that they could feel when their dragons banged. Yes, they could feel their dragons banging. This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname \"Violence\" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.\n\n\n\"you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”\n\n\nMy only thought was From Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.\n\n\nMoving forward to the things I liked.\n\nThe dragons.\n\n\nEnding my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn’t end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can't have everything we want. I’m happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I'd still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.\n\n\nSpoilers to follow :)\n\nLet's start with the worldbuilding!\nNow, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole \"war\" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author's primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.\n\nNow, the writing!\nThe sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can't tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let's discuss the fact that everyone talks like it's 2023, despite the medieval setting. I'm not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, \"Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?\" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don't think I've ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.\n\nNow for the characters. Oh, the characters.\nStarting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she's SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they're both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he's a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he's a traitor. I'm expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she's thrown into the Rider's Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.\n\nAnd then there's discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He's hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet's perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet's internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There's an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he's sparring with another guy. It's disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It's gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.\n\nHonestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.\n\nNow, the plot.\nThe majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don't because it's been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn't really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.\n\nI have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.\n\nAnd here's the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you've made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I'll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be. But good heavens, am I glad this is over with.\n\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "Yikes. This was not it.\n\nI usually enjoy CL for my beachy reads but just being completely honest, I really didn't like this one. I can sum it up in one word. BORING. It was so boring. It felt very formulaic and ok, I realize that these kinds of books tend to lean that way anyway but this one had no soul whatsoever.\n\nThe premise was about a reality dating show that casts the potential boyfriends based on archetypical tropes, the one that got away, the hero, the vampire ect. Very on the nose but ok, Fizzy, yes that's her name, is a romance author and the \"bachelorette\" of said show. But she has her eye on the single dad show producer, Conor, that she non-stop ogles and objectifies every second of the day.\n\nFizzy felt like a caricature. I think the intention was to make her this sex positive woman but instead it was actually her entire personality and it made her feel like this creeper instead. Conor just didn't have a personality and seemed to fall in love with Fizzy bc she was trying to jump his bones at every opportunity.\n\nSo yeah, I was so disappointed with this one especially since I know CL is capable of such magic like Love and Other Words and The Unhoneymooners.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Look at me, turning into a Christina Lauren fan.\n\nWhen I think back to The Soulmate Equation, one of the things which stands out most vividly in my mind is Fizzy. In fact, I'd wager to say she is probably the most memorable supporting character I've ever come across in a romcom. She's sassy, fun, and so sharp with a comeback, it brought an undeniable zing to every page she was on. So it's particularly exciting that CL decided to bring Fizzy back and make her the star of her own story.\n\nOf course, when authors revisit a character, there is always the fear that what made the character so special in another book doesn't translate to the new one, that the magical essence somehow gets lost. But I'm happy to report that nothing got lost here, ladies and gentlemen. Fizzy is just as scintillating and irreverent as ever, and I very much enjoyed her journey of finding her happily ever after.\n\nThe premise of this story is certainly an interesting one. I don't watch much reality TV, but I've caught a few episodes of dating shows while flipping through the channels and getting inadvertently caught up in the drama. After all, there is a reason they're so wildly popular. So I was definitely curious to see how Fizzy's dating show would shape up, and it ended up being a fun and unique one.\n\nI will say though, I've noticed CL has a habit of writing scenarios for their main characters that are somewhat questionable and unethical, and it happened again here. The whole point of a dating show is to enter into it to find a potential mate, and you can't do that if you're already having a side relationship. This is especially true if you're the star of the show, as it makes it incredibly unfair to the contestants who are dating you. This was even mentioned in the story by Fizzy and Connor as being a part of Fizzy's contract. And yet, the book never goes on to address this moral quandary and mostly glosses over it by making everyone happy for the couple, including the contestants.\n\nAnother thing that struck me is that CL is two white authors writing a Chinese American main character, which seems a bit tricky. But they did tread gently, and as a result, struck a good compromising note. If you're looking for a book on anything related to the Chinese American experience, this isn't it. The book doesn't dive too deep or really at all into that. But honestly, I feel like that's the right call, as anything more would've probably come off as forced or inauthentic.\n\nThoughts and quibbles aside, I really did have loads of fun with this story. Was it a bit cheesy and drawn out towards the end, with a third act breakup that totally mystified me, as in the way of most romcoms? Yes. But that doesn't detract from how overall entertaining it was. I just gobbled it up, all the while having a big, silly smile on my face.\n\nI never thought the day would come, but that's two Christina Lauren books I've enjoyed back-to-back. If that isn't a sign that I need to read more from this author duo, I don't know what is. The only question is, which of their 30 books should I go with next?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSee also, my thoughts on:\n#1.

        "Review 3": "Much like the multitude of readers who devoured the captivating Soulmate Equation crafted by this dynamic duo, I found myself thrusting my fist in exhilaration and exclaiming, \"Let Fizzy bask in her own story!\" This vivacious, intelligent, audacious, and vibrant woman holds the remarkable ability to command a scene and assume the perfect supporting role, rightfully earning her pursuit of a Happily Ever After.\n\nWhen my request for an advance copy of this book was met with rejection from the publishers, my disappointment manifested into days of heartfelt howling, prompting concerned neighbors to summon the animal rescue team to my doorstep. I laid my case to rest, clarifying that there wasn't a wounded animal within my abode; rather, a disheartened reader left without the means to satiate her yearning for romance.\n\nWith patience as my ally, I awaited the book's official release date. Once in possession of my own copy, I was pampered with an abundance of digital reviewer copies, a bounty that unintentionally led to procrastination in commencing this very book. Finally, having trimmed down my reading list by resorting to sleep-reading (my answer to friends curious about my seemingly insurmountable reading list, and even one inquisitive Goodreads member daringly suggesting I might be an A.I. - a comment that resulted in my comical fall from the couch), I embarked on this literary journey.\n\nNow, with this extensive preamble behind us, let us delve into the plot: Enter Fizzy - quick-witted, flirtatious, playful, an aspiring romance author who finds herself grappling with the loss of her creative spark as her faith in love dwindles. At the age of thirty-seven, she boasts an impressive roster of dates encompassing the entire male population of San Diego. Yet, her most recent heartbreak leaves her desensitized, hopeless, yearning for something to rekindle the energetic vivacity of her former self.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, her path serendipitously crosses with that of a charismatic British single dad and documentary maker - a man who effortlessly exudes the essence of a hot DILF mingled with the charm of a millionaire and the ruggedness of a lumberjack. Allow me to introduce the dazzling hero cocktail patented by the incomparable Christina Lauren: presenting the enigmatic Connor Prince III.\n\nConnor finds himself coerced into producing a high-budgeted dating reality show for the independent channel he serves. When he first glimpses Fizzy at a bar and later spots her photos adorning the back covers of his ex-wife's bookshelf, an audacious proposition takes shape: Fizzy becomes the star of a television spectacle, presented with the choice of twelve suitors to find true love, culminating in an all-expenses-paid trip to Fiji and an additional prize of $10,000.\n\nWhen Fizzy inquires as to why she was chosen, Connor eloquently explains that her readers span diverse age and socioeconomic demographics, boasting a significant overlap with the reality TV audience. The potential for synergy between her book sales and show ratings makes her an enticing contender.\n\nInitially inclined to decline, Fizzy's hesitation stems from the producers' intention to employ DNADuo Technology to ascertain the best matches for her. This technological approach, however, could leave her emotionally vulnerable, not only with regards to her relationship with River but also her unbreakable bond with her best friend, Jess. Yet, a slip of the tongue from Connor, unintentionally heard by Fizzy, prompts her to accept the offer - albeit with a twist that compels him to endure her outrageous demands: she insists on having eight men, each embodying a distinct romance archetype, including the elusive one-night getaway, the brooding vampire, the charming bad boy, the endearing tech nerd, the protective military man, and more.\n\nFor Connor, a challenge is an irresistible lure, and he meticulously assembles a group of candidates that are tailor-made to capture Fizzy's heart. It becomes evident that Fizzy is a natural fit for reality TV, yet the sparks between her and Connor ignite before the show even commences. A torturous twist unfolds as Fizzy begins dating the eight alluring contestants in front of Connor, igniting a burning jealousy within him. Paradoxically, as the show progresses, Fizzy feels her true self resurfacing as she spends more time with the contestants. She grapples with an undeniable attraction to Connor, recognizing the responsibilities he bears as a father and his professional obligations, compounded by the anti-fraternization policy in their workspace. The question lingers: Could her soulmate be someone who observes from behind the camera, a silent presence brooding as he witnesses her interactions with other men?\n\nIn summation, the chemistry between Fizzy and Connor is nothing short of perfection. I can genuinely attest that my adoration for this book eclipses even that of Love Equation.\n\nBoth Fizzy and Connor are endearing characters, and their witty, alluring, and saucy exchanges form the backbone of their irresistible connection. The chemistry that sparks between them sets ablaze every page, igniting a fervor that persists throughout. Not only is this one of the standout works of this dynamic duo, but it also earns a coveted spot on my list of favorite romance reads this year. I wholeheartedly recommend it to fellow readers seeking a sizzling, unforgettable tale\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\nmedium blog\ninstagram\nfacebook\ntwitter\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "4.5🌟\nSo…who’s a fan of reality TV? Maybe those “dating” shows that keep popping up everywhere? Yes? I thought so! Then you’re going to adore this book!\n\nFizzy Chen is a romance novelist that can’t seem to find love for herself. Her personal love radar is dead and now it’s spilling into her work, leaving her with a serious writers block. What must she do to restart her aching heart?\n\nConnor Price produces documentaries. (Boring!)🥱. But the company he works for is going in a completely different direction and asks Connor to put together a reality dating show featuring none other than Fizzy Chen!\n\nCan Connor pull off a wildly successful reality show and save his career? More importantly, will Fizzy at last find her love?\n\nThis book is listed as a stand-alone. But there’s several references to the previous novel, The Soulmate Equation. So if you do have the opportunity…read that one first and it’ll make the experience of diving into this novel that much better!\n\nI loved this book! Basically because I too have fallen victim to those crazy dating shows! Yes! It’s true! They’re fun, wild and make for good escapism!\n\nChristina (&) Lauren once again deliver a fun contemporary romance novel that will keep you laughing and cheering throughout! These two authors make an incredible team!\n\nA buddy read with Susanne!\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Gallery Books.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "i REALLY enjoyed this book!!! Fizzy was a funny and fiesty MC, Connor was a perfect book boyfriend, the plot was creative and i loved the character and plot crossovers from THE SOULMATE EQUATION.\n\nromcom’s aren’t typically faves of mine as i prefer emo romances, but this book had me laughing and smiling and vibing. Christina Lauren can do no wrong tbh 👏🏼 it felt like their tried and true, fun love stories.\n\nthe MCs had so much chemistry and i could totally feel the love story/connection. some scenes were also very steamy 🥵 and all of the banter and one liners were great. the characters are older adults so you can definitely see the maturity and growth/reflection they have.\n\ntypically reality show tropes and plots are an eye roll for me (i’m looking at you, THE CHARM OFFENSIVE lol) but this was a fun spin on the tv show trope and i enjoyed how it wasn’t the ENTIRE book—we had 150 pages of character and plot development before the show started and IMO, it wasn’t even the main plot which i very much appreciated. also one more round of applause for Connor… he was the best 🥹🥹🥹\n\n👉🏼 pro tip: if you don’t read THE SOULMATE EQUATION first, there will be spoilers!!!\n\nthanks to Gallery Books for the gifted early copy. this will be a fun one to pick up and a perfect beach/pool binge when it releases in May!\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "This is hands down my new favorite Christina Lauren book!! A MUST read for all romance fans and the perfect sequel to The Soulmate Equation.\n\nWhat I LOVED:\n1. The Premise! A successful romance writer is casted as the lead in a reality dating TV show and falls for the show’s producer. What could be better?!!\n2. Fizzy! I loved her in The Soulmate Equation as a supporting character but she made an even better main character. Her sex-positivity, bluntness, and humor made her so likable and there was something special about watching her find joy in a place where she least expected to.\n3. Connor! I know I say this after many romance books but he is now my book boyfriend. I loved how sincere, caring, open and honest he was. The way he fell for Fizzy and appreciated her for her was perfection. Plus, he’s British… and tall.\n4. The FLIRTING! Seriously this book has the BEST banter and there were so many times I was full on laughing out loud. The added element of forbidden love and forced proximity while filming made all the angst and tension shine.\n5. The single parent trope! Connor is a single parent, which is a favorite trope of mine because I always love when romances add kids to their stories.\n6. All the Jess/River! I was surprised by how big of a role Jess and River, and even Jude, played in this book. CL did a great job refreshing you on all the small details from The Soulmate Equation too, so I didn’t feel lost in the beginning, especially because DNADuo was tied into the reality show.\n7. All the pop culture references!!! Yes, Harry Styles got mentioned twice :)\n8. The grand gesture! It was perfect and while it easy to predict how the story would play out, it didn’t take away from the enjoyment whatsoever.\n\nThank you SOO much Gallery Books for the ARC! This one comes out May 16th and is so worth it :)!!\nShow more",

        "Review 8": "My Reviews Can Also Be Found On:\nTwitter - Amazon - Storygraph - The Book Review Crew\n\n3.5 Stars\n\nI didn't read The Soulmate Equation as this is my first book by this writing duo. The main character of this book, Fizzy, was also a character from The Soulmate Equation but this is definitely a stand-alone. This isn't my usual type of book but I wanted to give these popular authors a chance and I have to say it was pretty funny and sexy. And for a romantic comedy, it was emotional too.\n\nI really liked both Fizzy and Connor as characters and as a couple. There was wonderful banter and connection between them. Like I said I don't normally read this kind of book but they were hot AF. I don't watch reality shows like The Real Housewives or The Bachelor and the fact that I liked this book even though there is a Bachelor-like show as the main plot says a lot about how well done this book is.\n\nFizzy is a strong, independent woman who goes after what she wants but Connor is no push-over. The book is very realistic with ex-boyfriends, ex-wives, kids and job issues. I really liked that about the book too. I don't think I'd read any other books by these ladies as it isn't my cup of tea but I can certainly see why they're so popular.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️(5/5,Romance)\n\nIf you are a romance reader, don't even bother with my review. Just get your cute butt into your car, beeline to your nearest bookstore or library and grab this baby.\n\nThis book reads like a love letter to romance novels and those who create and enjoy them. I was left over the moon happy as if this love story had happened to me! Which is quite simply why I love romance novels. I was consumed by butterflies and first-date anticipation reading this. Can you believe this is Christina Lauren's 30th book!? I always loved getting lost in their sexy and fun stories, but this book felt different. I am no literary critic, but their writing was better than ever. The banter was funnier than they've ever written, the spicy scenes were more delicious, and the whole big fat book was just… heart eyes romance perfection.\n\nThis love story is about Fizzy Chen & Connor Prince. Fizzy is a romance novelist who's recently hit a wall with her writing. While normally she's churning out swoony romance novels and dating the eligible men of San Diego, we find her at a point in her life where it feels like she's hit a wall when it comes to her writing and dating life. Connor is a serious documentary filmmaker forced to produce his first-ever reality dating show as the studio he works for needs a cash cow, and Connor needs the job to stay close to his daughter. When Connor meets Fizzy by chance, he is struck by inspiration- wouldn't the world love to watch their favorite romance novelist fall in love? (Answer: yes, we loved watching her fall in love!)\n\nI think I made the synopsis sound really cheesy, but honestly, this story is fresh and funny.\n\nThis book is sexy, funny, and just downright delightful. I honestly cannot wait to see what Christina Lauren writes next.\n\nI don't consider this book a B.R.A.D. as it's plot-driven vs. \"when's the next time they're gonna bang\" driven, but it is hot, sexy, with open-door scenes. Christina Lauren got their start writing BRADs, so we are in expert hands when it comes to the steamy stuff.\n\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "WOWZA! A 10 star wonder! This book sizzles! It was funny, light, entertaining with enough drama to hit all the romantic quotas. 'The True Love Experiment', along with 'Love and Other Words,' are my favorite Christian Lauren books. These ladies know how to write!\n\nFizzy (Felicity) Chen is a character from the previous book 'Soulmate Equation.' Though this is not a sequel or a spin off, it's a book for the beloved character, Fizzy. She was absolutely hilarious in the first book and I couldn't wait to read her own quest to find love.\n\nFirst of all, I love the author's decision to make the protagonist of Asian American decent without focusing on her being \"different.\" It was seamless, the way it should be. Fizzy is provocative, hilarious, and independent. She says what she thinks, thinks how she feels. As a romance author, she's in a writers block. When Connor Prince, a filmmaker is sequestered to step out of his usual documentary films and make a reality show, he chooses Fizzy, the romance novelist as the main character.\n\nFizzy and Connor immediately fall into something more than just coworkers, but the biggest dilemma--they can't be together. She's looking for love in a reality DATING show, she can't fall for the producer of the show.\n\nThe True Love Experiment builds characters with intense chemistry, the kind that comes once in a life time. This isn't an enemies to lovers story, but a love to lovers story of two people bound by duty and rules. It was intense and unputdownable. I loved the character of Connor, he was not broody or mean, simply upright. Their connection was ELECTRIC, the kind that makes you feel whiplash and enough character jealousy and desperation for you to smolder.\n\nThe writing was crisp and witty with dialogue that was perfectly congruent with the plot.\n\nOverall, a fun, exciting read with enough predictability to keep you grounded.\n\n**PS— listened to the audio version that came into Libby a month later— and let me just say—Connor with the British accent is worth the listen!\n\n5/5 stars\nShow more"

        "Review 2": "Pride Month\n\nFirst of all, can we all just be extremely pleased that a trans romance has been traditionally published? More diversity in publishing, please and thank you.\n\nI am not embarrassed to say I 100% requested this book for the cover. I love the height difference. I love books about food. I go back and forth about Frenchmen, but in this case, I think I prefer Jean-Pierre to Luna. Admittedly, there are reasons why Luna is very \"woe is me.\" Life doesn't come easily to marginalized people.\n\nWhile the romance didn't feed me, I will say learning more about differences in trans people did. I like that this book didn't shy away from sex scenes. I had an issue with the French stereotypes. One second JP speaks perfect English. The next he is fumbling around for a particular word. And are we just going to gloss over the fact that Luna studied French for a few weeks and was suddenly fluent in Paris?\n\nSo yes, I have a few problems with the plot, but I am here because trans voices deserve to be heard. One more thing, and this is just because my best friend works in TV. Do not hire a showrunner that has never worked in TV. Please please please.\n\n📱 Thank you to NetGalley and Atria/Emily Bestler Books\nShow more",

        "Review 4": "A T4T m/f romance in which newly unemployed trans woman Luna gets into a fake dating thing with super rich French guy JP and must learn to cook a Michelin level menu with him in a week when she literally doesn't know how to crack an egg. The TV / cooking / inheritance set-up is wildly improbable but who cares.\n\nThere's a huge amount to like here. I loved JP, the frankly absurd French guy (all black clothes and nihilistic remarks), and kind of wish we'd had his POV because it would have been hilarious. Luna is a lively and determined heroine, and the relationship is in many ways great, with much fun had out of the fake dating premise, and a lot of sweetness as well as hotness.\n\nThe issue I had is very much a YMMV, and also one I've seen in a few romances recently, which is the book basically takes one character's side. In this case, Luna is pretty much always right in every interaction, and even when she argues with JP because she feels he's doing transness wrong, there's no sense that he's entitled to his feelings, however misguided she might think them. I can absolutely see that a fierce trans woman hero owning everything/everyone around her is going to be a big part of the pleasure of the book for many readers, but a character who isn't ever wrong doesn't really get to grow, and by the end, Luna's determinedly 'small town USian in Paris' approach felt a touch limited to me.\n\nI realise that \"a proper American gas station burger is better than a poncy Michelin-starred meal\" is a deeply beloved trope of US culture, so again, many people's responses will differ violently. In the end, I wanted her to be open to a wider world, spread her wings, and make the most of having a super rich French boyfriend, but that wasn't what Luna wanted, and it's her book, so there we go.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Not only was this super fun & funny, it was so romantic & swoony, & was the first T4T romance I have personally read (& while I know there are a bunch in the indie realm, I’m curious if it’s the first in trad pub?) & that was more impactful than I had even imagined it would be. Still gathering my thoughts, but I loved Luna & Jean-Pierre so much & am super grateful this book exists.",
        "Review 6": "I am very bummed this one didn't work for me. A t4t romance! Traditionally published! Yay for more queer romances!\n\n\nThere were elements I did really enjoy:\n\n-Luna and her mom's relationship was very pure and tender, I really loved seeing such support from a parent.\n-Some of the chemistry was off the charts for the leads. There were adorable cuddling moments, vulnerability, and some great times where they opened up emotionally. I liked how Luna would push back on Jean-Pierre's internalized transphobic or sexist comments and make him think a little bit. I liked how they could argue and fight with each other, while afterwards apologizing and not running away. Conflict resolution is great.\n-Hooray for explicit sex scenes in a tradpub, we love to see it.\n\n\nHowever, the list of things that didn't work just kept growing as I reflected on them:\n\n- There's such an emphasis on trans people's genitals in the real world, I might be extra sensitive to it. There's an almost scientific info dumping approach to explaining a phalloplasty and vaginoplasty in this, while the leads are having sex. It was clunky and also at the least sexy time.\n- This book couldn't decide if it was going to be a very realistic contemporary romance where real world issues were sprinkled in throughout the story (the heroine is very outspoken on trans rights, Black justice, capitalism, ethics, etc) or if it wanted to be a very wish fulfillment \"rich man comes and takes care of all my problems, pays my bills, and looks at me like I'm the sun and the stars.\" Both are great elements to include in stories; it is really hard to not point out the blatant hypocrisy and contradiction when combining the two. Are we not going to talk about eating the rich to our millionaire boyfriend?\n- THE COOKING PLOT WAS UNREAL. You're going to tell me that two people who can barely crack an egg without getting shell pieces in it can go from 0 cooking skills to learn how to cook highly technical dishes AND ALSO bake desserts in like a month or two? In what world. Again - if this was going for the \"suspend disbelief and roll with this plot\" element, that's great. However, so much real-world shit was holding this plot down to earth.\n- There's about 2 million adjectives and descriptions of food, cooking, baking, and eating, that got old very quick.\n- This could have gotten rid of 50% of the cooking/fake dating plot and added in actual scenes with the leads getting to know each other, and dating. It felt like the best moments in this were the handful of one-on-one moments between the leads. Lost opportunity.\n- This got very preachy and info-dumping at times, even for me.\n- The bigot grandpa plot was cartoonishly evil with his competition and cooking requirements.\n- How could you take such a beautiful name like Jean-Pierre and shorten it to JP. Pleaase.\n- I really hope cis or non-queer readers who read this book don't make the assumption that T4T romances must include leads having top and/or bottom surgery, or have to \"pass\" in order to be trans. I really am stressed that this will be the only romance with trans leads someone will read, and the assumption that surgery, HRT, and passing are the 'norm' or requirements in the community. (It's not.) I loved that these leads both wanted surgery and hormones and were mostly able to get them. I am worried that it'll be generalized that it's the norm to do these things for trans folks to fit into a cis-normative world.\n\n\nOverall, this left me stressed, and grumpy at times. Is it because I'm a part of this community (I'm nonbinary) and am holding it to higher standards compared to other queer romances I read? Is it because this is tradpub and a bit out of my element? Are my own fears being projected? Did I have exceedingly high expectations that this didn't meet? Probably yes to all of this.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "This was exceptionally cute and also quite revolutionary in terms of trans representation. I have read a lot of romances with trans characters and there are very few traditionally published t4t romance. So that in and out of itself is fantastic.\n\nWe also have two trans characters who have different opinions on what being trans means for them and they argue about queerness and what it means to be queer and it was just kind of refreshing. It was also a little bit infuriating but I think that's just my bubble talking. Queer people are not a monolith and having characters be able to have different views but also be so respectful at the same time is a really impressive feat. I should mention that these different views are small things and nothing that is so divisive that a relationship couldn't work.\n\nAnyway this whole book is like fake dating crossed with \"oh no I have to do this very specific thing to get the money in the will\" trope. I can never remember what that's called.; So we have Jean-Pierre who is a very opinionated grumpy French trans man who has to do this cooking competition thing for his family of chefs in order to qualify for the will. He ends up having to fake a lie about having a girlfriend and that's where Luna comes in. Luna is sunshiny but also an absolute badass who is not willing to take shit from anyone including the man who's paying her six fucking figures to fake date.\n\nLuna and Jean-Pierre have very different experiences when it comes to being queer and being trans and seeing them learn about each others experiences and develop a begrudging friendship was really great.\n\nThe last 20% of this book is absolute chefs kiss. Just sheer perfection. I really enjoyed the entire thing but the last 20% just was amazing.\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "god-tier t4t energy on this cover\n\nUPDATE: I read it and loved it!\n\n“You let me be more myself than I have ever been in my life.”\n\nMy kingdom for a thousand t4t romances with as much nuance, wit, and heart as this one! CHEF’S CHOICE is a queer romance between Luna, a recently-fired administrative assistant, and Jean-Pierre, a wealthy French heir to a culinary empire. It’s the second in Alexander’s cooking-themed romance series, and fans of CHEF’S KISS will be thrilled to see Simone and Ray again. Luna and Jean-Pierre’s story begins with a chance encounter at just the right moment that embroils the pair in a fake-dating scheme to help Jean-Pierre gain his inheritance through an extensive cooking test. I won’t lie, the plot of this story did not have me hooked - it’s implausible, as many romcom storylines are, but didn’t lean enough into the ridiculous for me to really enjoy it - but I barely noticed, because I was so enthralled by the love story unfolding between Luna and Jean-Pierre. The fake-dating-to-real-feelings journey is a delight, bursting with sparkling chemistry and slow-burning mutual respect and affection. There’s a sunshine/grump dynamic between them, with Luna’s humor and lightness and Jean-Pierre’s moody clothing and existential despair. The story is told from Luna’s perspective, making her obliviousness even more delicious as you start to see how love-sick Jean-Pierre is. As two trans people, they share so much (the mutual hormone injection scene is so beautiful) and yet consistently differ - in how they feel about passing, the ways the handle the many transphobic experiences they encounter, their articulation of how sexuality intersects with gender, how they engage with other trans people, and more. I loved the nuance captured in their conversations, how they cherish and honor each other even when they disagree. I think this is the first t4t romance I’ve ever read, and it’s bittersweet: Alexander has done an incredible job celebrating the love between Luna and Jean-Pierre, and I’m hungry for so many stories like this, saddened that we have so few. I read this fervently, reverently, heart pounding, grinning like a fool; I adored it. Thanks to Atria Books for the eARC! This book is out 5/30.\n\nContent warnings: transphobia, family rejection\nShow more",

The fake dating should have lasted minutes but things get more complicated as there’s an inheritance at stake and all the money to start a new life. As they get to know each other better they realize that their paths have been very different but life has brought them together.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "An eminently readable romance starring two trans leads engaged in a nonsensical fake-dating scheme for an even more nonsensical “chef test.” Chef’s Choice was a breeze to get through with a very likable protagonist, even if the plot was both paper-thin and seemingly nonexistent. I’m honestly not quite sure what events the 300+ pages of this book were taken up with, but I enjoyed the ride nonetheless.\n\nI liked both Luna and Jean-Pierre—they both were kind of messy and dramatic and annoying, but in a fun way that made them feel like truly real people. It’s difficult to write realistically-exasperating people in an endearing and amusing way, so I was impressed with the characterization. I especially loved Luna’s positive mantras and deep breathing exercises and Jean-Pierre’s rich French “strange little guy”isms. They’re just funny characters and it made following their initially-disastrous partnership all the more entertaining. I was also a fan of how their differing viewpoints about “being” trans were explored and often provided sources of friction: Jean-Pierre is more isolated and, perhaps, “normative,” while Luna has a trans support system and less interest in assimilating into dominant cis ideas of proper gender performance. None of it came across as a Gender Theory 101 lesson; the conflict felt natural and ended up in a nice give-and-take. I haven't read many T4T romances, and I'd like to read more.\n\nAll that being said, I wonder if the simultaneously fun and thoughtful interplay of Luna and Jean-Pierre made their romantic storyline less compelling than just watching them become friends. While reading, I almost felt like the story as told seemed better fit for a prelude to the main characters’ romance. There would be flashes every now and then that one of them was feeling attracted to the other, or developing feelings for the other, but I’d say only about half of those romantic moments actually seemed suited to where they were in the relationship or hints we’d had before about their chemistry. Which is not to say that I wouldn’t want to see a romance from them or that they didn’t seem like good love interests—but maybe there was a lack of professed attraction in the beginning and an emphasis on their strangership from Luna that made the romantic plot beats (especially near the end) seem out of tune with their story. One chapter Luna thinks of JP as an odd little French guy and the next she has the brief desire to get dirty in a pantry—then she's back to finding his rich man coffee habits odd. Maybe a little bit more insta-love would've worked better for me, haha.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "Rare Singles\nThe is the latest offering from Ben Meyers and it is just wonderful, completely different from Cuddy. It is set in the north of England: Scarborough (known to some as Scarbados with a certain level of irony!) to be precise. The novel has a certain level of nostalgia for me as well. The centre of the novel is a Northern Soul weekender. This might take some explanation. Northern Soul is a movement from the late 1960s and 1970s onwards focussed on the North and Midlands of England. It is all about following soul music, a certain type anyway. Not the Motown type, but with a heavier beat and faster tempo. I won’t bore you with a list of songs and artists (although I could). There were certain nightclubs where Northern Soul devotees met: in Manchester, Blackpool, Stoke, Wigan Casino (in Wigan). Wigan Casino was mine when I could escape the clutches of my parents. There are a couple of films about Northern Soul: Soulboy and the imaginatively titled Northern Soul.\nNorthern Soul devotees still meet for weekends of music and nostalgia, usually in seaside towns around the country. Scarborough is one of those. It has a sort of fading grandeur about it, which Myers captures well.\nRare Singles has two main characters. Earlon “Bucky” Bronco made a few singles in 1967/8 which went nowhere. He is now over 70, recently widowed with plenty of health issues. These days the singles he cut are collectors items and his name is well-known on the Northern Soul scene, something he is entirely unaware of.\nDinah is part of the group organising the weekend and she is looking after Bucky for the weekend. This is the story of the weekend. I haven’t mentioned the seagulls, I probably should, they are ever present. Myers seems to be good at offbeat friendships and this is another example.\nThis is just a joy from start to finish and it’s not often I say that.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "God help me but I love Ben Myers work. If you read all his novels one after another you'll be utterly puzzled about what genre the man works in. Thankfully it's most of them. On finishing Rare Singles he said it was nothing like his last book (Cuddy) and won't be anything like his next. I can't wait till the next one to find out what we get.\n\nFor now we have Rare Singles which, at the beginning, probably refers to those singles that might be called one hit wonders, the ones that blaze then disappear. If you find a mint copy you'd be (as we say in Yorkshire) \"quids in\".\n\nThe story of Earlon \"Bucky\" Bronco had been that of a one-hit wonder up to the point he finds himself on a plane heading for England to play a weekender in sunny Scarborough on the North Sea coast. Bucky had one hit but due to circumstances made no money and no more records.\n\nHowever, that one single is a Northern Soul classic and now the enthusiasts led by Dinah Lake want the ageing Bucky to perform. Bucky has no idea what he's walking into. All he wants is something to take the edge off the pain - physical and emotional. Why are all these people so happy to see him anyway and how do they all know his song?\n\nNo folks this is nothing like Cuddy or The Offing or Gallows Pole. But it is a book written with love and passion. It's also very funny. Dinah, Bucky, Shabana and Hattie are great characters. Scarborough itself plays a role but the seagulls may just take star billing.\n\nI'm a Yorkshirewoman so reading about home territory is always interesting. I was turned onto soul and Northern Soul by my dancing/music loving husband. The subject matter is therefore right up my alley but you don't need to know a thing about either to recognise a story about love, passion and redemption.\n\nMyers has yet to put a foot wrong for me. His versatility is incredible and I loved the humour in this latest novel. Just sit back, listen to the music and enjoy this wonderful book. Highly recommended.\n\nThankyou very much to Netgalley and Bloomsbury Publishing for the advance review copy.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Without any doubt, Rare Singles is one of the best reads of 2024😊\n\nEarlon \" Bucky\" Bronco is a soul singer; in 1968 he recorded two /three songs that never saw the light of day of success in America but went onto become Northern Soul classics and hots in Europe.\n\nJump ahead half a century and Bucky is invited to perform at Soul Weekender in Scarborough.His life has been a struggle for survival -physically and mentally; widowed and addicted to painkillers he finds himself in the North of England- a common language - not really- a different culture -certainly- but the underlying struggles of 'getting through ' everyday are apparent in both societies.\n\nBucky's host is Dinah - a supermarket cashier married to an alcoholic and with a son addicted to porn and weed. Soul music is her escape and she is to be Bucky's guide and support over his three day visit.\n\nBenjamin Myers has created two of the most beautifully heart-warming and moving characters in contemporary fiction.\n\nBucky struggles to get through each day and when he finds he has left his painkillers on his flight, how will he get through his time in Scarborough let alone sing- he's never performed in public. Dinah is trapped in her life and 'the fear of the unfamiliar' to make a new start but meeting Bucky makes her understand that there is a wider world and other perspectives.\n\nThis is a story about aging and life passing- the fears of a missed life and lost opportunities but it is also a story about the timelessness of music, the power of nostalgia and how for just a few weekends a year people can be glad to be alive as a communal bond is ignited through the love of music.. This is also a book about personal survival - being trapped within our communities, families and existence. Even the USA and England come under Benjamin Myers scrutiny- two nations now adrift and in decline.The book does not veer away from the darker side of addiction\n\nBucky's life is retold- his marriage to Maybellene , the tragedies and personal loss that detoured his chance at musical success and life peppered with exploitation and violence.. But this a story of hope and new starts recognising what makes us happy and grabbing those moments of joy . With the addition of Shabana( a cleaner at the hotel where Bucky stays and a hip hop fan) , Hattie (a German music journalist sent to interview Bucky) and Dinah- the trio help Bucky realise that life still can go on.\n\nThe analogy of Bucky and his life in decline and an English coastal town which has seen better days could not be clearer - each fighting to hold onto past glories with the hope that maybe something might improve\n\nThis is a winner - from the very start you want Bucky and Dinah to find happiness and calm; this is not sentimental but a truly beautiful novel that should be /will be a huge success. ( I can envisage the TV series or film )\n\nMemorable Quotes:\nGrief is the price of love\nThey say poor is sate of mind and broke is a state of wallet\nIt seems to me that the internet is taking the brain in directions that evolution hasn't accounted for\nEngland- a dusty old island that needed a lick of paint.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "DNF at 66%.\n\nThis is a gentle character driven observational story about an American soul singer, Earlon “Bucky” Bronco, who has had no fame at home in Chicago, but gets invited to a “Weekender” Northern Soul event Scarborough in England - due to a level of fame and adulation in the UK that he was previously unaware of. His host, Dinah, is also struggling in her home life, but finds solace in the music. Bucky battles his own demons of physical pain, drug addiction and bereavement, as he tries to find his place amongst an enthusiastic crowd of Northern Soul fans.\n\nThis should have been an emotional and engaging story. The characters of Bucky and Dinah should have felt real to me, in a way that I could have connected to. The writing style is lyrical and poetic, especially Bucky’s inner monologue - his observations of the world around him are detailed and expressive, which ought to have given Bucky and emotional depth.\n\nBut, for reasons I can’t quite put my finger on, I couldn’t connect to Bucky or Dinah - I felt like I was being told about their thoughts and feelings, rather than experiencing them. And without that emotional connection, the slow story progress and expressive, detailed passages of Bucky’s experiences and thoughts felt like wading through descriptive treacle in order to get to the next plot point. Perhaps also due to my lack of emotional engagement with the characters, the growing relationship between Bucky and Dinah also felt forced, and their moments of connection then felt slightly saccharine.\n\nThis is a shame, because I really wanted to enjoy this book, and the characters of Bucky and Dinah should be sympathetic, and have an interesting journey. In the end, I found myself skimming over descriptive passages that should have been emotionally engaging, and continuing beyond that point wasn’t going to benefit anyone.\n\nThank you #NetGalley and Bloomsbury Publishing for the free review copy of #RareSingles in exchange for an honest review.

        "Review 5": "4.5\nTrying this new Myers novel was a last attempt to see if his writing will grow on me.\n\nRare Singles has at its centre Bucky Bronco, a seventy-year-old Chicago man, recently widowed, down on his luck, barely making it through the day. He was invited to Scarborough, United Kingdom, to sing songs he had composed and recorded when he was seventeen. He's got nothing better to do, he's paid for a week in England and this will be his first time on a plane and in another country.\n\nDinah is a middle-aged cashier at a supermarket, a huge fan of Bucky's and soul music in general. She's the one picking him up from the airport and getting him to places. She also explains to incredulous Bucky how important his singles are to her and not only.\n\nMyers characterisations are masterful, with real, flawed people, but plenty is good about them.\n\nThis is a story about grief, second chances, and the power of music, with kindness at its centre. I was completely under this short novel's spell and became invested in the characters' lives.\n\nI would be remiss not to mention Danny Sapani's masterful narration.\nShow more",

Absolutely wonderful.\n\nIt might also make you want to visit Scarborough and go sea swimming.\n\n5/5\n\n\n\n\nDinah has always lived in Scarborough. Trapped with her feckless husband and useless son, her one release comes at her town's Northern Soul nights, where she gets to put on her best and lose herself in the classics.\n\nDinah has an especial hero: Bucky Bronco, who recorded a string of soul gems in the late Sixties and then vanished off the face of the earth. When she manages to contact Bucky she can't believe her luck.\n\nOver in Chicago, Bucky Bronco is down on his luck - and has been since the loss of his beloved wife Maybelle. The best he can hope for is to make ends meet, and try and stay high.\n\nBut then an unexpected invitation arrives, from someone he's never met, to come to somewhere he's never heard of. With nothing to lose - and in need of the cash - Bucky boards a plane.\n\nAnd so Bucky finds himself in rainy Scarborough, where everyone seems to know who is - preparing to play for an audience for the first time in nearly half a century. Over the course of the week, he finds himself striking up new and unexpected friendships; and facing his past, and its losses, for the very first time.\n\nWise, hilarious and profound, Rare Singles is an unforgettable story about the power of music and friendship to bring us back to ourselves.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Earlon “Bucky” Bronco has held a variety of low paid unskilled jobs during his lifetime to make ends meet. The only thing that’s kept him going is the love of his wife Maybelle. Now in his mid 70s, Bucky is mourning Maybelle who had died of cancer a year ago. Back in the 1960s, Bucky cut four soul singles, only one of which was released and even that didn’t trouble the Billboard charts.\nHowever, unbeknownst to Bucky, back in the 1970s, a craze developed in the north of England for obscure 60’s soul singles made by artists who never achieved the giddy heights of fame of Aretha Franklin of Stevie Wonder. Bucky’s only released single “Until The Wheels Fall Off” soon became a cult favourite of the Northern Soul aficionados of Scarborough.\nDinah Lake is one such fan and she manages to track Bucky down and send him an invitation to perform at a Northern Soul Weekend. For Dinah, trapped with her alcoholic husband, stoner son and boring supermarket job, these weekends are all she lives for.\nWhen Bucky finally arrives, he suffers more than just a culture shock, including a Hitchcockian nightmare with the local seagulls. Scarborough, like many English seaside towns reached its peak back in the late 1950s. After that, with cheaper air travel becoming available, many holidaymakers preferred to spend their summer breaks in the sunnier climes of Mallorca or the Adriatic and the English resorts went into decline.\nIt’s impossible to overpraise this novel. It manages to be poignant yet funny, brutally honest yet heartwarming where even seemingly trivial matters are made profound. A story of how, despite all their troubles, people can find redemption through a shared love of music.\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "My experience with Myers' work has taught me that he is able to become a chameleon writer, changing his style, his themes as per the subject at hand per book. I've not liked all his books, those I really liked were 5 stars and I still remember the good feeling I got after reading them. I'm referring to Pig Iron, The Perfect Golden Circle, and The Offing, of course.\n\nI thought at first that this one was going to be like that, but then the dreaded thoughts began coming in, the thoughts and the dragging of feet to open my kindle. Hmmm.... this was something to be examined. Why did this happen? What was I feeling? For God's sake, this book had people swimming in the cold North Sea. What more could I want? Believe me when I tell you that I spent the whole book urging Bucky to buck up and go to the water and enter.\n\nSo I'm going to tentatively point out that the story, the people, the countries felt a bit cliched. We have the lost America of the downtrodden African Americans and their so so unjust treatment. We have the opioid crisis with the resultant addiction, we have chances lost because yes you're black and poor, but mostly black. On the other side we have a depleted UK, drowning in alcohol and stodge and people trying to make do whilst hating their lives. Then we have the redeeming factor. no, it's not Zoltar, but the soul music and salvation through it. You just have to believe and keep faith, yes you really do.\n\nDuring the first half, I still believed that Myers would do the deed and, by the end, get me trancelike to that golden hour. I did try, but the opioids did not do their deed on me.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "SpoilersSo very lovely.Dinah and Bucky were the people I most deserving of a happy ending that I've met in a while.But, goodness did I worry that wasn't going to happen.Wheres the rehearsal guys? I was stressed!Realistic on the way life turns out, but heartwarming too.... I'm left with a smile on my face.As I said, lovely.",
        "Review 10": "Fantastic characterisation as always and a beautiful ending with a nod to The Offing. How I love the versatility of Myers’ work. Recommend this one for fans of David Nicholls."

        "Review 1": "This book made me feel ✨Nothing✨\n\nLook I enjoy Ana's books a lot, twisted was one of the series that helped me get into reading romance novels because they were fun, cute, easy to read and short!! Her series Kings of sins has been okay so far but they were all being recycled so I was so happy when I found out that she was writing a sports romance INSTEAD of another billionaire romance but 👹\n\nBRING BACK 300-400 PAGED ROMANCE BOOKS 🙏🏼\n\nThis had no reason to be 700 pages long?? like its was literally so long and I thought that maybe there would be something fun that she had planned because she was hyping it so much but there was ✨nothing✨ it was all yap no slap. The writing style was so weird?? like the more books that I read from hers the more distant I feel...this is not the writing that I was a fan of 😔 Its sad because she was one of my auto buy authors and four consecutive disappointing releases aren't helping her.\n\nNow onto the main problems:\n\n. Literally nothing of substance happening in 700 pages like there were cute moments but when the book is feeling sloppy getting long even the cute scenes feel boring like I dont skim but there was a point where I started skimming because it was just getting to annoying. What happened to planning? what happened to editing?\n\n. The characters, now they might be the ones that made the book bearable for me but if you honestly look at it they only had a few (emphasis on few) cute scenes and worked somewhat well together (which they were for a significant amount of time) but if you separate them from each other and see them as individual characters you will see nothing because there was nothing to see!! character development was found dead 😒 you're telling me that there's zero development in 700 pages?? the character were the same at the end as they were on page 1, they were so one dimensional ISTG like I need good characters. Asher was a good MMC but he was just good not great or anything extra ordinary, I liked the gestures that he did tho and Scarlett ??? thats all I can say because ????\n\n. This book was so damn predictable and like you would say Clace this is a romance novel and I KNOWWW but still its like?? I know whats gonna happen from the first page why should I bother reading it?? its not like there's anything fun or cute happening. Like I love reading cliche 2000's romcoms because at least they're fun to read and they're short with thing that actually enjoy this was the exact opposite of that. It had everything to be honest brothers rival, forbidden romance, sports, training coach but failing to deliver at those tropes is embarrassing\n\n. The romance, Where??? where was it?? sorry for being repetitive but they have sex on page 200 out of a 700 paged book and it was so mid like it made me feel bored and I skimmed it because there was insta lust, the classic I just met him why am I already hard/wet for him/her and then them fucking but they had like zero chemistry, zero tension, zero angst, zero pining, zero banter so the romance was overall zero like spicy scenes are Ana's strong suit but they were all so mid. I think there are four- five scenes and only one ( the mirror scene) was fun to read the other were pfft 👎🏻 Vincent (scarletts brother) had more chemistry than her and Asher.\n\n. The plot, 😂😂😂😂 WHERE???\n\n. The third act break up 😭😭 it was so dumb and unnecessary, it made no sense and it was so messy the whole overall conflict of this book was dumb and messy like please dont write about things if you dont actually feel about it and everything about it was so inconsistent like Asher racing plot line and even scarletts crash one. Also talk about being forgiveness 😍 like what the fuck was that scarlett?? if that is all it takes for her to forgive Asher, he'll be getting out of many thing.\n\n. The side characters, Vincent was the only one I liked. Brooklyn and Carina were so mid even Adil and the other guy LIKE why is it so hard for you guys to write about fun, enjoyable side characters???\n\nThis was easily Ana's most dumbest, snooziest, boring, frustrating book to date. I have never been this disappointed in her like WHYYY and I was so excited that the next book was vincents...but my expectations are on the floor.\n___\nI have never read a football romance so I'm SUPER EXCITED 🤭 also wanted Ana to venture of into something new 🙂‍↕️\n___\nBrother's rival is such a goated trope!! Ana you must ace it 😤\n___\nThe way Ana's serving with all the Asher scenes in king of sloth 😌\n___\nAna Huang writing a football romance wasn't on my 2023 radar but I'll gladly add it 🫡\n\n----> Fall 2024 will be my time 🤭\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "★ 1.5 stars\n\nthree perfect words to describe The Striker: tedious, underwhelming and forgettable.\n\n-ˋˏ ── this review will contain a few spoilers. don’t keep reading it if you haven’t read the book yet or follow at your own risk.\n\nthis book was genuinely such a waste of my time. i won’t even lie and say that it had potential because i didn’t even think that before going into it; i expected nothing and guess what she delivered? that’s right, nothing! a whole bunch of nothing.\n\nAna Huang’s lastest books disappointed me a lot, so deep down i had a feeling that this one would be another disappointment to add to the list which is the reason why i wasn’t expecting much — but even so, i decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and check out her newest novel to see if she had made any improvements. spoiler alert: she did not. there’s nothing new under the sun, this is as disappointing as her most recent books. am i frustrated? well, yes. surprised? not really.\n\nthere’s so many things that i disliked here that i honestly don’t even know where to start, so apologies in advance if this gets all over the place. but let’s get into it, shall we?\n\none of my biggest issues with The Striker was its length. why is it so freaking long? i really don’t get it, nor did i like it. just to be clear, i’m not saying this only because i didn’t like the book; even if i had liked it, i’d still complain about the length because i’m a firm defender that contemporary romances shouldn’t be over 500 pages. it’s just unnecessary and pointless to me. sure, there are a few exceptions out there and at times i can see why some romances have to be lengthy because they have so much to unpack in terms of plot and they actually have an interesting story to tell. however, that was definitely not the case here. i can guarantee you. there wasn’t really a lot of [relevant] stuff to unpack and the plot overall was weak, clunky and shallow. it seemed like the author didn’t even make an effort to come up with an engaging and well thought out plot. needless to say, it was not something that needed to be developed through +600 pages given the fact that it lacked the substance (among other million things) for that.\n\nand, on top of all that, the pacing was off. it was all over the place and i wasn’t a fan of it. sometimes it was way too fast and sometimes it was way too slow, no in between. also, there was so much happening and nothing happening at the same time. we would get a bunch of pages filled with basically ✨ nothingness ✨ and then all of sudden we would get whiplashed with random drama coming out of nowhere (not the good kind of drama, i must point out, so it wasn’t even worth it).\n\nas for the main characters, Scarlett DuBois & Asher Donovan, they were... um... okay? i guess? i won’t bother to write two separated and detailed sections to describe my thoughts about them because i frankly don’t have a lot to say. if you asked me to talk about their personalities or something like that, you’d hear crickets chirping as i wouldn’t be able to come up with anything. all i can tell you is that i didn’t connect with them and i found them both unremarkable, insignificant and bland. that’s it. and while there were times where i found myself getting annoyed at Scarlett and/or Asher, i didn’t particularly feel exactly hatred towards them. the thing is that these two just didn’t captivate me and i couldn’t care less about each one of them. they were not memorable in the slightest.\n\nand what i’m going to say might seem a little obvious, but i couldn’t care less about their romance either. i actually hated it. let me explain it to you why.\n\n↳ firstly, they literally had no chemistry together whatsoever, throughout the story i’d often think “is the chemistry in the room even with us right now? i can’t feel it.” not ironically, i think Asher had more chemistry with Scarlett’s brother [aka his nemesis] than with her, which is... very telling.\n\n↳ secondly, there was nothing exciting about their relationship. i adore forbidden romance, forced proximity, secret relationship and brother’s rival, but the execution of those tropes here was bad, to put it mildly. i’m a bit shocked that Ana Huang managed to fumble some of the best romance tropes out there, she had the formula right there and yet she couldn’t do it justice. Scarlett and Asher’s story didn’t make me feel any spark, didn’t make me swoon, didn’t even make me root for it — i just felt nothing. i kept waiting for that to change so i could see them in a different light, but unfortunately, they never won me over.\n\n↳ thirdly, i think their relationship progressed a little too quickly for my liking. what’s the point of writing a long romance book if you’re going to make the main characters get all over each other so early in the story? please, ms. Huang, explain to me like i’m five because that doesn’t make sense to me. Asher and Scarlett were lusting over each other from the get go — no surprises here as the author is always pulling that — then they had their first kiss not even 30% in (in a +600 pages long book, bear in mind) and not so shortly after they were having sex. what’s even the fun on that? why not develop their relationship a little more slowly and give us more to look forward to? why not deliver a great build-up? there was absolutely no need to rush things. if we’ve had a good slow burn and lots of tension and pining and angst, i guess this book would’ve turned out somewhat decent at least; but sadly, those four things were basically non-existent here.\n\n↳ and fourthly, everything was so predictable. i mean, yeah, this is a contemporary romance novel so it’s not exactly hard to guess what will happen, i know that! but still, it was so annoying here because even the conflicts between them were easy to predict. the third act breakup was the easiest one — you could literally see it coming from a mile away, i’m not exaggerating. and it was absolutely annoying, by the way... i loathe third act breakups, especially stupid third act breakups. why can’t authors just ban them for once and for all? it’s getting old, folks.\n\nso, to conclude this review, let’s state the obvious: The Striker was not worth my time and i disliked every second of it. it’s not the worst book i’ve ever read (trust me, i’ve read worse) but it’s a book that i regret reading.\n\ni thoroughly enjoyed Ana Huang’s work in the past, the Twisted series was good, but all of her books after that have been lackluster and disappointing. i think that maybe it’s time for me to stop reading her work since i feel like i’m not exactly the target audience for it anymore. i’m officially saying goodbye to this author. for now, at least; perhaps in the future i can change my mind about that, who knows? i’m not so hopeful, honestly, but eh... we just have to wait and see.\n\n💌 before we wrap this up, i couldn’t forget to say that the most [probably only] enjoyable thing about this book is that i had the opportunity of buddy reading it with one of my best friends, ivy, and she made the experience less unbearable and slightly more fun. love you, veve! thanks for coming on this journey with me. ♡\n⤿ make sure to check out her review as well.\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "Beware of the man who wants to protect you; he will protect you from everything but himself. - Erica Jong\n\nOh my god, this was terrifying.\n\nAs with the other Megan Abbott novels I've read, I'm not sure how to categorise Beware the Woman. Like the others, it is... sort of a contemporary about women and the shit we go through. But it's also dark enough that it sits comfortably in the mystery/thriller section too.\n\nThough, going with my gut, it felt something like a horror to me.\n\nIt starts off eerie and unsettling. A pregnant woman called Jacy and her new husband Jed head off into the wilderness of Michigan to the place Jed grew up. There, a creepy housekeeper seems to lurk in every shadow, a mountain lion roams the forest nearby and everything Jacy's father-in-law says and does seems to have a hidden meaning that she can't quite grasp.\n\nEven the mundane seems sinister in Abbott's hands. It's hard to know whether you're reading a contemporary about a young couple or whether you've stumbled into Rosemary's Baby territory... but it is damn effective.\n\nWhat starts off as a nagging unsettling feeling gradually builds into a suffocating anger and fear. There is a point in this book where I was a living horror cliche-- edge of my seat, heart in my throat, holding my breath without even realising it --needing to know what happens.\n\nThere's no need for a plot summary beyond what the blurb tells you, but I'll just say that this book perfectly captures the suffocating feeling of being ignored, dismissed and controlled for your \"protection\" and \"your own good\". It's about men taking ownership of women's bodies and excluding them from the conversation about their own rights and needs. There is not a word strong enough for how frustrating it is to have a man talk over you and insist they know what you need better than you do.\n\nThis book was maddening and frightening, especially as too many parts of it didn't feel like fiction at all.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Okay! I was so close to enjoy this slow burn, creepy, claustrophobic, psychological novel! Feminism vibes against old school- extra traditionalism and extremely chauvinism approach was intriguing concept for me! Rebecca meets Rosemary’s baby theme crashes into an irritating house in the middle of nowhere theme also worked brilliant for me, too. The problem was abrupt ending. I felt like I got the wrong copy. I think that book needs a prologue that gives us closure we need.\n\nThat’s why I lowered my stars to 3 still solid, promising stars! The tragic story, the dysfunctional family drama were well executed. I found Jacy a little naive and Jed extremely unreliable. Dr. Ash and Mrs. Brandt gave me creeps.\n\nLet’s take a look at the plot: Jacy has awful taste in men. That’s what her mother thinks and her past experiences also verify that assumption.\n\nWhen she falls too hard for Jed: creative artist designs neon signs, she finds herself married with him in a few months and without waiting any further she gets pregnant. Jed thinks it will be good to her to rest at his estranged father’s secluded cottage and hormone fueled-confused- emotionally unbalanced Jacy accepts it! Oh Jacy why you let your man make entire silly decisions for you.\n\nDr. Ash-Jacy’s father-in law lives at Iron Mountain, with its bus-tling seven thousand residents, but two dozen miles further, deep into a dense, mossy forest that eventually stretched into Wisconsin. The secluded house is cut out from civilization. You may guess there’s also no phone reception and Wi-Fi cause her father in law is too old school with so many unusual thoughts about women’s place in the earth which should be urgently upgraded. He still grieves for his wife he’s lost during Jed’s birth( 30 freaking years) and their mysterious, prying caretaker Mrs. Brandt taking care of entire house.\n\nAs soon as they arrive at the house, Jacy gets frustrated of her father in law’s overprotective manners about her baby as if she’s not capable to take care of him/ her and she starts seeing different face of her husband Jed she is deeply in love with. Mrs. Brandt gives her suspicious vibes and their family friend Mr. Hicks thinks she shouldn’t be here!\n\nCould Jacy put herself and baby in danger by coming this house? What kind of the secrets this dysfunctional family is keeping away from her?\n\nOverall: as I told I had no problem with slow burn mystery but in my opinion this book yegen needs an additional chapter to wrap things up.\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and PENGUIN GROUP PUTNAM , G.

        "Review 3": "Megan Abbott has outdone herself with her latest book and her venture into adult horror territory. Now don't go thinking ghosts, monsters, or knife wielding madmen, oh no, this horror is much more realistic making it even more terrifying.\n\nJacy, a recent newlywed and just going into her second trimester of pregnancy, goes with her husband Jed to visit his father, Dr. Ash, in upstate Michigan. To call this place off the beaten path would be an understatement. No wifi and no cell signal seems almost quaint and peaceful at first until it no longer does anymore.\n\nDr. Ash is charming, charismatic, and he welcomes Jacy with open arms, gleaming smile, and twinkling eyes. She can't believe her luck at having married Jed and now having Dr. Ash as her father-in-law.\n\nAfter Jacy experiences a medical scare things begin to change.\n\n\"The finest woman has some filthiness in her. She can't help it. Eve's curse.\"\n\nThe sense of menace in the air is thick as sludge. The claustrophobia is palpable. The disorienting nature had my head spinning, wondering, what in the actual fuck is going on?!?!? 😵\n\nI realize this book isn't going to be for everyone. It's weird as hell and won't appeal to the masses, I don't believe so anyways, but this was damn near perfect for me. If I had to compare this reading experience with another book then I'm Thinking of Ending Things is the first one that comes to mind minus all the philosophical back and forth. It's the feeling, the vibe, and all the what the fuckery Abbott so gladly puts her reader through that makes them similar. This one starts out on the slow side but, be warned, you had better buckle up before she puts the pedal to the metal.\n\nThe ending was fantastic even if it does leave the reader hanging a bit. An epilogue may have been nice but that is really my only complaint and not a big enough one that I'm willing to even deduct a star for it.\n\nThis book had me seething with my heart racing and my blood pumping. Now that's my kind of cardio! Beware the woman, indeed! ALL. THE. STARS.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Penguin Group - Putnam for my complimentary copy.\n\n\n\n\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "This book was weird. I felt like a good 90% of it nothing was happening and when it finally started to pick up, the book ended. I wanted more from the ending. There are some trigger warnings about abortion and a few graphic scenes. I think the book was supposed to explore the relationship between mother and child as reflected by the mountain lion. However, I was not a fan of this at all.\n\nJacy and Jed were the fools that rushed in. They got married quickly and not too long after, they got pregnant. Four months into their new lives, they visit Jed’s father Dr. Ash. Dr. Ash lives in an isolated house surrounded by woods and ferocious animals.\n\nAt first Jacy is flattered by the reception she gets from Jed’s father and tries to ignore her husbands odd expressions. But things quickly get weird as Dr. Ash becomes increasingly overprotective and controlling over her. He becomes consumed with protecting his unborn grandchild no matter what the cost.\n\nBeware the Woman is available May 30,2023.\n\nThank you to netgalley and penguingroup for this arc in exchange for my honest review.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Unpopular opinion alert. This book did not work for me at all. The flowery writing was meant to make this an atmospheric thriller but it made it entirely too long and even more boring. The weird parallels between Jacy and her baby to the mountain lion and her cubs didn't make much sense for me and added nothing to the story. I listened to this on audio and my biggest writing pet peeve was very prevalent through out the book. Constant repetition. Shush shush click, shush shush click. Or Jacy replaying things other characters had said over and over and over ad nauseum. I felt like nothing happened at all except Jacy observing all the sights, smells, and sounds around her with more adjectives than should be legal until the last 30 minutes of the audiobook where we get a Scooby Doo style telling of what happened in the past to explain what was happening to Jacy in the present. The ending was abrupt and not at all satisfying but honestly, I was just glad it was over. Thank you to PRH Audio for my complimentary ALC.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "Currently at a 3.37 Goodreads’ rating?????\n\n\n\n\nSeriously though. Haters, man.\n\nMy friends gave this high marks . . . which is why I keep my friend count next to nothing. I’m assuming everyone who disliked this is still busy creaming their jeans over the new Riley Sager. And the shout-out to Todd is intentional here. While I have developed an appreciation for his ability to make a mint writing knockoffs, Megan Abbott’s newest (although probably not inspired by it at all) gave me all of the creepy Rosemary’s Baby vibulations. You know from the start that something is up with Jacy’s father-in-law . . . it just takes a long time to get there. This one is all about the ominous feeling you get while turning the pages. It is a slow roller, but one that confirms why I pick up every single new thing Megan Abbott puts out. She’s amazing.\n\nARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

Dr. Ash plays an important roll and I questioned his true intentions, a very odd character.\n\nWhat I liked most about this book is how the suspense is presented. It subtly builds, leaving a sense of unease. Trust issues come across strong and I kept questioning the true nature surrounding these characters. I am disappointed with the ending and wished for a bit more information to close it off.\n\nThe twists and turns are perfectly placed, ensuring that the tension keeps pace. I would have preferred a slightly faster pace at the beginning, but I do understand why Abbott crafted this novel the way she did.\nShow more",

Now that he doesn't require total attention all the time, I requested this from Netgalley and they approved. Netgalley still thinks I'm somebody, I guess.\n\nI wasn't sold at first. It seemed unsettling and I was horrified to think Jacy would end up banging her father-in-law. Spoilers, she doesn't. The craziness comes in baby steps so things sneak up on your. Reading this on the heels of Lock Every Door, Megan Abbott succeeds with the psychologic suspense where the other book failed. It helps when the characters have some personality and seem pretty fleshed out.\n\nLike I said, I wasn't thrilled with it at first but when I started sensing the wheels would come off at any moment, it was very hard to put down.

The first one I read was “You Will Know Me,” and it was good enough, in terms of giving me something to read - my favorite of hers so far (although I’ve never read so much about a character’s deformed toe in my entire life). The next one I picked up was “Dare Me,” which was just awful. But I figured that one might have just been a fluke, so I went on to read “Take Me by the Hand,” (interesting in ways but ultimately a bit meh) and then “The Turnout,” which was better except for a poor ending. Then I checked this one out, Megan Abbott’s newest.Y’all. Never, ever again.As others have mentioned, the constant repetition was tedious. Especially towards the end of the book, it seems that Abbott indulges her penchant for repeating words simply for the purpose of making the story last longer. Jacy (ugh, that name) uses words and phrases over and over, almost obsessively, and does the same for quotes from stories or conversations that she hears. If these parts had been removed, the book would be a good bit shorter (and perhaps sound a bit less like a YA novel, which, I like a few YA novels, but only when, you know, the book actually IS a YA novel).As for the actual story, I have issues there as well. Jacy’s entire personality was just.. her being pregnant. That’s it, that’s Jacy. That’s all you need to know. I guess there’s slightly more there, in that she has a good relationship with her mother - or is it not so good? who knows - and she is wildly in love with her husband.. when he isn’t violently assaulting her in bed and being a dick on their honeymoon.The abuse by Jed, the husband, is never examined in any way. There’s no explanation, no resolution, nothing beyond the one or two stray memories that Jacy shares of those incidents. Similarly, it’s never revealed why Dr. Ash was insane, either. Why the creepy sexist bullshit and the “all women are worthless whores” mentality? Again, who knows.And, since I’m from northern Michigan.. I don’t know if the author drove through the region for a single day and randomly decided to set her next novel there or what, but she got a lot of things wrong. It’s true that Iron Mountain isn’t a bustling metropolis, but if you are anywhere near that town, you definitely don’t need to make the long, long drive to Marquette for supplies of any kind. Like. Just head to Walmart, boo. Walmart is about all you’d find for shopping in Marquette as well, so idk what “supplies” they’d be hoping to get there really. And flying out of Marquette (the airport there actually isn’t even in Marquette itself, but research is hard I guess) wouldn’t necessarily be what you would do if leaving Iron Mountain, either, depending on where you’re going.Also, little things were inaccurate, like descriptions of day trips to see sights that are nowhere near Iron Mountain, and would be long, planned out, all day affairs with a ton of driving. Miner’s Castle is not at all close to Iron Mountain, and some of the towns mentioned are definitely not in proximity to Iron Mountain either. I know, I know - Jacy is only “near” Iron Mountain. That doesn’t change anything.Mountain lions don’t behave the way they are depicted here (CAN they? Sure, I guess. But are they LIKELY to?). I can forgive some artistic license on that front for the sake of a plot, but since this part really didn’t amount to much in the book it just kind of feels like more ignorance and stereotyping about wildlife in the Upper Peninsula. There are so many interesting species roaming those woods; Abbott could have at least picked something more common to the area, like a bear or coyote, to make this threat more believable. I know we’re supposed to connect the mountain lion and its cub to Jacy and her pregnancy somehow, but all references to that were a bit nonsensical and were kind of out of nowhere.And let’s talk about the main demographic makeup of the region, shall we? Guess what?It’s Finnish. So, so many Finns. So many. Sooooo many (now who’s engaging in word repetition? Save me). And there’s even more people with German ancestry, I believe! I’m not saying there aren’t people of Cornish descent there. I’m not saying there’s no one else or that those other groups are invisible. Heck, I’m not even saying that aliens don’t come zooming out of the sky and settle their fancy UFOs to eke out a new community for themselves in between the scraggly pines deep in the Michigan forest. But I AM saying that you can’t throw a pinecone without hitting a Finlander in Iron Mountain/Marquette/Petosky/Munising/wherever Abbott thinks we are from chapter to chapter.It’s about details. Research. Character development!But, you know, Jacy is pregnant (in case you missed it) and her father-in-law really likes babies, so from out of the dark Michigan woods a thin plot is born (and kept on life support).P.S. Cudighi is not pronounced “coo-dee-gee,” it would be more like “could-ih-gey” (ih kinda like if, and gey like key), and no that isn’t perfect but it’s certainly not COODEEGEE. I will not be okay unless I put this out into the universe, so there it is."

Jeanie and Logan have pretty good chemistry but wasn't a fan of insta love. The fact they wanted each other after their first meet was a bit much. A slow burn would have been much better. I would have still rated it four stars had it not been for the third act break, it was so stupid and kinda made me dislike Logan 😅 Not every romance book needs to have a third act breakup and I wish authors would seriously start considering that.\n\nAnyway, it's a super easy read and despite the two issues, I still had a good time with it.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "This had the potential to be a really cute, autumny romance but ugh, I hated the love interest.\nUp until the epilogue I wanted to shout “go see a therapist!”\n\nAlso, this is one of them books where if you took a shot every time there was miscommunication, you’d end up on the floor.\n\nAnd to top it all off, there was the insta-love!\nLike, you people barely know each other, you are not in love.

Every crisis doesn’t need to be resolved within a few paragraphs!!!!!! Let’s linger for a moment!!!!!\n\nTo use a term from the title: this book is like a carved out pumpkin — pretty on the surface but so hollowed out that we’re left with no real substance.

It's about enjoying the simple pleasures of a feel-good, heartwarming story without expecting it to redefine literature.Made me think about the act “art of noticing”.\n\n\n\"No one could live a laid back, quaint, small town life with a murderer outside their back door.\"\n\n🍁Cozy autumn/ fall vibes\n🍁Grumpy/sunshine\n🍁small town romance\n🍁a bit of spice\n🍁found family\n\nOne of the sub-plots was mystery.

Fall was better for snuggling and eating food covered in gravy\"\n\n\nWhen Jeanie inherits the Pumpkin Spice Café, she brings her cheerful spirit and pumpkin spice lattes to the town.\nLogan, a grumpy (hottie) farmer with an aversion to town gossip (he has a reason for it), will find his world turned upside down with Jeanie's arrival.I loved the relatable hesitation from Logan after his broken heart and Jeannie trying to prioritise re-inventing herself over her niggling fondness of Logan\n\n\n﻿\"Wow, new Jeanie was bold. Maybe it was all that farmer smut she'd been reading; the way that milkmaid really chased her own pleasure.\"\n\nI have to say, the love story moved very fast which was slightly unrealistic & the town was a little too perfect.\nIt definitely has Gilmore Girls vibes, but it also made me think of Hart of Dixie and Virgin River which i adore.\n\nSo, take it for what it is: a delightful escape into a cozy world,with a little bit of a pumpkin spice🌶️🤏🏼\nShow more",

        "Review 10": "This was worse than a Hallmark movie (and I love Hallmark movies). I know I’m choosing to read cheesy, cliche fall books - but this one was almost unbearable. The writing and dialogue made me want to cringe the whole time. I could barely make it through…almost a DNF. Best part of the whole book were the farm animals being named after pop stars."

        "Review 4": "Billionaire/CEO type romance. The MCs accidentally get drunk married, then realise it would be useful for career reasons because the corporation for which he wants to be CEO wants him to be married (we just go with this trope okay). As it happens she's known she's in love with him for ages, and he has been in love with her without knowing it, so it's really a matter of them both taking the leap, plus interference from aunties, friends, siblings, evil fathers, corporate boards (I said we just go with it).\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the Punjabi elements here--the aunties, the various ceremonies, the cultural insights. Veera is a likeable heroine, battling a lot of bad feelings relating to her controlling father and critical mother, but standing up for herself well. Deepak is mostly a pretty likeable hero, frequently oblivious and gets things wrong but doesn't generally have to have them explained twice. I particularly liked a point where the heroine is presented with evidence he's betrayed her \nand simply, immediately calls bullshit because she knows him better than that. Veera's relationship with her sister is fun in a prickly, awkward way. I did want a lot more of Sana and Olivia's story as Olivia is frankly great and they are both hugely messy bitches.\n\nI remain a bit confused by the Shakespeare branding. It starts with a shipwreck and there's a partner swap involving twins and a woman called Olivia, but that's just machinery, it's not what makes Twelfth Night. I was looking forward to, I don't know, complex deception, gender shenanigans, truth under lies, impossible longing...maybe no cross gartering but surely yellow stockings. ahem. I sort of feel if you're going to do a retelling you have to lean in more heavily. However, I don't see why it's necessary in the first place because this book didn't need to rely on another source: it's a very absorbing story in its own right which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "4.5 stars. Combining a retelling of Shakespeare's Twelfth Knight set in the world of high-stakes NYC finance with an excellent friends-to-lovers romance that reminded me of one of my favorite Taylor Swift songs, Marriage & Masti brings Nisha Sharma's If Shakespeare Were an Auntie series to a near perfect curtain close and is my favorite of the series.",
        "Review 6": "I really enjoyed this modern take on Twelfth Night! The way Veera and Deepak end up accidentally sort of married is clever and I enjoyed the movement of their friendship into a real relationship. It was a bit spicier than I was expecting, but that dynamic was also interesting given what these characters are like. Thematically, this is about feeling like the odd one out when you're the last of your friend group to be in a long-term relationship, and also about how there can be a different kind of strength in women who are \"nice\" but not pushovers. I enjoyed it and would recommend it if you like her writing!\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Ok so friends to lovers where she falls first but he falls harder is quickly becoming a favorite scenario of mine in romance books. There’s just something so magical about that moment when he finally finds out how she’s felt all this time. Throw in a fake (tho it’s kind of real) marriage, and I just DIE. So many swoony and giggle inducing moments are in this book, I swear. This is easily my new favorite of Nisha’s books. Like, wow.\n\nAnd on top of the romance, this was a huge love letter to single, successful, women who often feel alienated. The sisterly love and female friendships also made me very emotional! Just, a remarkable book.\n\nThere was ONE spicy moment I didn’t love in the ENTIRE book, but otherwise, all the spice was very hot and well choreographed. Like, Nisha had me clutching my pearls.

It feels like only yesterday I was in awe seeing the cover of Dating Dr. Dil for the first time, and now we’ve gotten the love stories of everyone in the Kareena-Bobbi-Veera and Prem-Bunty-Deepak trio. These characters honestly feel like a second family, and it’s so bittersweet that we won’t be getting more stories about their shenanigans. 😭\n\nI love how in each of the novels in the trilogy, Nisha always sends the message to brown women to keep their standards high to receive the love that they deserve. The following slides contain some snippets of Deepak’s love languages when spending time with Veera. These are also some of my favorite scenes from the novel. 🥹 Just from these quotes alone, you can tell how wholeheartedly he loved Veera, and would truly move worlds to keep her in his life. Like Dating Dr. Dil and Tastes Like Shakkar, this book is so filmy and heartwarming and reminiscent of so many Bollywood movies we love.\n\nThank you Nisha for writing such an unforgettable series, and I can’t wait to see where your upcoming releases take us next!\n\nThank you so much to Nisha & Avon for sending me an ARC!\nShow more",

First of all, if you haven't started this series then what are you waiting for, i need more people to read it because it's well-written, spicy, and diverse. This book is a friend to lovers, accidental marriage turned marriage of convenience and it was great. The main characters had unrequited love where the fmc loved him first and then he did, but they didn't know. This had all the vibes of wealthy Indians with family business, parental trauma, and lots of cultural references. I loved all the descriptions and scenes with the Sari dresses, bangles, Hindu traditions, Indian weddings, and food.\n\nI really liked the romance, friends to lovers is really growing on me y'all. The main characters friendship was so sweet and they had that closeness that comes with being friends. The tension though was giving especially with the characters trying to figure out their feelings and how real their marriage was. There weren't too many steamy scenes but the ones that were there were good. Of course, I recommend this book for anyone who loves contemporary romance! Thank you Nisha Sharma and Avon for this arc for an honest review.\n\nRead for:\n- Friends to lovers\n- Accidental marriage\n- Close-knit friend group\n- Shakespeare retelling\n- Indian mc's\n- 🌶️🌶️\n\n4.5✨✨✨\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "She wonders how terrifying it felt . . . looking at the sea, feeling like she was at the very end of it all. She wonders what it was that made her realize there was somewhere else to go.\n\nWhile The Wedding People wasn't a perfect read for me, it certainly was a darn special one.\n\nPhoebe has always wanted to go to the grand Cornwall Inn in Newport, and now she is finally here. But it isn't at all the vacation she spent years dreaming of. For one, she isn't going with her husband because he is no longer her husband. For another, she didn't bring any luggage because, well, you'll have to read the book for that. And just as she has resigned herself to her decision, she unexpectedly meets the wedding people, all there to attend a week-long celebration. Soon she is swept up in their exuberance and drama, and just maybe this is the vacation she was meant to take after all.\n\nThis is definitely one of those books you read for the journey, not for the outcome. It's pretty clear right from the beginning where this story is going to go, because how else would you have a story at all? To follow Phoebe as she meets these strangers, see how they touch her life at exactly the moment she needs it, while she in turn touches theirs, brings a lump to my throat and a flutter to my heart.\n\nThere is something so inherently loveable and relatable about Phoebe, even if we have not all suffered the exact same terrible setbacks in life that she has. Her candidness and vulnerability seems like a breath of fresh air, inviting the reader into her heart and her mind, and we have no choice but to follow along.\n\nNo doubt Phoebe has been through a lot, more than anyone can be expected to endure. And yet, there is a quiet bravery and courage in how she approaches her life and in how the author chose to portray her. I can see how at the hands of a lesser wordsmith, this story could've easily turned maudlin or preachy, but no such fears here. For a story about such sad topics, I felt remarkably buoyant and hopeful while reading this.\n\nThere was so much heart and humor in here, I was often nodding and laughing along, surprised at all the little nuggets of wisdom and joy to be gleamed from these pages. If I were someone who marked up books (which I would never, the sacrilege!), I suspect I would've used up an entire highlighter trying to capture all the worthy lines.\n\nI mentioned this wasn't a perfect read for me because while I particularly loved the beginning and the end, I did feel the middle sagged a bit. At times, it was a little overly long and meandering, with dialogue that was a bit too clever and may be verging on glib. And yet, the story continued to draw me in, even if the pacing wasn't quite even throughout.\n\nI will say, I think this is a story best enjoyed with a reader's full and undivided attention. Often it feels like there were a multitude of things going on at the same time—the rapid-fire dialogue on the surface, the emotions underneath, and the wisdom to be sussed out if looked carefully. Unfortunately, it's hard for me to find solid chunks of uninterrupted reading time nowadays, so the book did lose some of its potency for me read in bits and pieces, a few lines at a time, especially in the middle there. But that's really my bad and not the story's fault.\n\nI feel like the most resonant books are always the ones that address the human spirit—its unfailing desire to endure, to belong, to love and be loved, and to find meaning. And if you can sprinkle in a dash of humor along the way, all the better. Well, if that's the case, then one cannot ask for a better story than this.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "if i'm not supposed to judge books by their covers, why do they have such beautiful ones?\n\nand i have to call this installment of picking reads based on visual aesthetic a success. what a damn good time!\n\nthere is no medicine quite like the subgenre of book club fiction in which everything starts out completely terribly and then is incontrovertibly solved within a few hundred pages. it's restorative, like a good haircut, or a well-toasted bagel. keeps ya going.\n\nthis is a great example of that especially, because it's funny. books are rarely funny. i'm a really big fan of them (and i have the serial killer-adjacent level of meticulous goodreads history to prove it) but even i have to admit it. not exactly the go-to location to laugh any harder than when you kind of puff air out of your nose.\n\nbut this was funny, and soul-healing, and (although predictable in its plot points and its half-twists) pretty unique.\n\nbottom line: a pretty big win for judging by covers, i have to say.\n\n(thanks to the publisher for the e-arc)\nShow more",

        "Review 4": "I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! i am so sad it’s over and i know it will stick with me for awhile—the best feeling ever if you ask me 🫶🏼\n\ni loved so much about it—the characters, the message, the topics, the humor, the storyline, the ending 🙌🏼👏🏼 and Helen Laser (narrator) brought the humor and all the personalities to life SO well—all the characters were iconic and hilarious and necessary in their own way and they truly depicted “wedding people” to a T. plus it ended EXACTLY how i wanted it to.\n\ni binged the audiobook in under 24 hours but would have finished in one sitting if i could have. if you’re an audiobook girlie, definitely do that route for this one. some parts will have you laughing until you cry (true story… i found 1 specific scene so funny i kept rewinding it to laugh again and had tears streaming down my face and the girl next to me on the plane was deff concerned😂)\n\nthe author covers many heavy topics with such grace and in delicate way, yet makes the overall situation so relatable and humorous. and can we talk about the overall theme behind treating strangers with kindness? in today’s world this is more important than ever.\n\nthis book was perfect—there was truly nothing i would change 🥹 it’s been a minute since i’ve felt this passionately and happy about a book and if you’ve been following me for awhile, you know my 5 stars are rare.\n\ni also loved the quotes here and there about the monotony of life and what happiness truly means. two of my fave quotes:\n\n“This is exactly what Phoebe has always hated and about life—how unpredictable it is. How things can change in an instant.”\n\n“Life is strange. Always thinking that this one thing is going to make you happy. Because then you get it. And then you’re maybe not as happy as you imagined you would be. Because every day is just every day. Like the happiness becomes so big you have no choice but to live inside it. Until you can no longer see or feel it. And so you start to fixate on something else.”\n\n1000/10 folks!! pick it up!!!!\n\n*also if you’re reading this and can relate to Phoebe (trying to keep spoiler free), please know you are loved 🫶🏼 i hope a stranger smiles at you at the airport or the coffee shop and turns your day around 🤍\n\nthanks to Henry Holt for the gifted ARC and LibroFM for the gifted ALC!\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Words cannot do justice to how brilliant this book is. The author left me speechless, a blubbering machine like those waving cat statues you see in Eastern places, with the exception that I kept repeating, \"I love it! I love it! I love it!\"\n\nPhoebe is real! She's not an ordinary book character. You can easily see parts of her that are similar to you: resonating, bluntly honest, depressingly expressive, a woman who finally dares to say enough is enough, leaving her old life with only a dress and uncomfortable shoes, without looking back, just aiming to cut away the pain like a rotted piece.\n\nShe's smart, sarcastic, depressed, exhausted, trapped in her unhappiness like a hamster stuck in a treadmill going nowhere, counting her steps as she keeps counting the days passing without hope, plans, or desires.\n\nHave any of you turned into Phoebe, who stopped seeing her value, drawn into self-suffocation as if you have full of options, have so many talents you didn't explore, a brain that holds encyclopedic knowledge but still seeing yourself from a cracked mirror perspective, dulling your motivations? This book is for all women who are stuck in the routine of life, preferring not to talk about their honest opinions, putting others' needs first!\n\nWhen Phoebe Stone, in her mid-forties, is dumped by her husband of two decades, having gone through IVF treatments, miscarriages, losing the charm of her job as a literary (Victorian era) professor to interact with students, and her unfinished thesis about Jane Eyre, a tragedy pushes her to the limit. She leaves her house wearing only a green dress she bought for a special occasion but never had a chance to wear, and gold heels that probably create blisters on her feet. Without a bag in sight, she finds herself at Cornwall Inn, a luxurious hotel with nightly costs around $800, located in Newport, Rhode Island. She has a secret that she blurts out in the elevator to Lila, who has paid to close the entire hotel for wedding festivities: Phoebe is going to kill herself with pills she's carried to her ocean-view expensive room.\n\nOf course, Lila the bridezilla, at age 27, has her own problems besides organizing her dreamy wedding without hiring a wedding planner because she cannot trust anyone not to ruin things on her special day. She misses her father who recently died from cancer, and his dying wish was to see his daughter as a happy bride. But now she's dealing with her eccentric, daily-drinking artist mother who keeps telling her she's making a mistake marrying the older Gary, choosing an incompatible guy just as she did with Lila's father. Gary's sister Marla, who was involved in a sex scandal, cheating on her husband, keeps nagging her with inappropriate, grumpy comments. Her teenage stepdaughter Juice/Melanie acts like she hates her guts. Her mother-in-law thinks if they don't marry in a real church, her wedding will be ineffective. On top of that, there's a wedding crasher in the hotel called Phoebe who plans to take her own life, adding more tragedy to her perfect day! How dare she!\n\nInterestingly, Lila keeps knocking on Phoebe's hotel room door to get advice because this stranger might be the only honest person who can tell her the truth, including if there's a piece of food stuck in her teeth.\n\nPhoebe also realizes that talking with Lila and finding herself involved in the wedding drama helps her get out of her dark space. She finds herself fraternizing with the guests, turning into a priest who listens to anyone's confessions without being stuck in a booth, including the bride's mother, sister-in-law, Gary's ex-brother-in-law Jim (who might have feelings for the bride), and of course Gary, the groom, with whom she becomes friendlier than she could ever imagine.\n\nWhat if she can have other chances to grab in life, leaving her old self hanging on the coat racks of her closet and jumping into a new life? What if Lila is also rushing into the wedding to realize her late father's wishes without thinking it through? What if there are other paths to follow which will force them to face what they really want to do with their one precious life?\n\nThis humorous satire balances drama and humor perfectly, just like life itself! Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the top ten books of the year you shouldn't miss! The characters, the plot progression, the blossoming friendship of two polar opposite women (smart, snarky, self-reliant Phoebe and controlling, perfectionist, slightly superficial white privileged princess Lila), the promising romance parts, the irony, the heartfelt moments, self-awareness about mental health, learning to let go, and being brave enough to start over messages are perfectly developed!\n\nThis is a MUST-READ that you shouldn't dare to skip!\n\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\n\n\nmedium.com\ninstagram\nfacebook\ntwitter\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "The Wedding People\nArc Review- 5 Stars\nPublishing Date 7/30/2024\n\n“But life is strange, always thinking this one thing is going to make you happy, because then you get it, and then maybe you’re not as happy as you imagined you would be, because everyday is still just like everyday. Like the happiness becomes so big, you have no choice but to live inside of it, until you can no longer see it or feel it. And so you start to fixate on something else”\n\nI’m obsessed. I found a new comfort read. I immediately pre-order this book once I was finished.\n\nThe Plot-\nPhoebe hits rock bottom, She always wanted to travel to Newport, Rhode Island, so she decides to go and she rents a room in an expensive hotel, but when she gets there she realizes she just crashed a wedding weekend.\n\nWhat To Expect and Content Warnings:\n🍾Mental Health Representation\n🍾Dark Humor\n🍾Wedding Week Vibes\n🍾Infidelity\n🍾Depression\n🍾Death of a Spouse/Parent\n🍾Suicidal Ideation\n\n“Nobody can take care of you the way you need to take care of yourself. It’s your job to take care of yourself like that”\n\nMy Thoughts-\nThis book is absolutely amazing. This would be an amazing movie that I would pay top dollar to watch. This is one of my favorite books this year. The story is captivating, the writing is beautiful. This book is filled with humor and heart. This book at its core is about human connection that we all crave and everyone we meet is for a reason.\n\nAll the characters in this story were well liked. They all had a story to share. And I was so invested in each story. I had empathy for all of them. The characters were flawed but yet relatable. You really see how most people you know are lonely and miserable but put up a facade that everything is okay.\n\nGoing to touch on the two FMC\n\nPhoebe- my black cat sassy protagonist. I LOVE her. She is such a well written character you can’t help but fall in love with her. I really wanted to take her under my wing. Her character development was top tier.\n\nLila- ahh the spoiled rich girl that’s getting married. Honestly I adore her. She was so delulu and comical. I was really rooting for her happiness as well.\n\nI think that both these FMC complimented each other so well. You have two ladies that are polar opposites but mesh so well. I love their weird friendship\n\n“At night she stared at her sagging breast and her thin skin over her hand and wondered what happened to her” “I had been too embarrassed then,” she says. “Simply put, I thought I was fat, but what a shame because now I see that I was too young and beautiful then not to be naked all the time” 🥹😭🥹😭\n\nThe authors writing style really stood out to me. I really felt like I was throw into the world of Phoebe walking besides her while she survived the wedding week. The dialogue was incredible. Filled with so much charm, humor and meaningful conversations. I see some complain they didn’t know what chapter they were one but that didn’t bother me at all cause everything meshed together so well, the narrative was crafted well that I was emotional connected.\n\nOverall I would recommend this read. I really hope the book gets the hype it’s deserves. I can sit and break down this book chapter by chapter and rave about it, but I truly think this is a book a lot of people will enjoy and relate too.\n\n“It’s all about moving on.

        "Review 7": "Confession: I skimmed most of this novel and you wouldn’t be able to convince me that I missed anything.\n\nOne thing about me is that I love sad novels. I love books that deal with grief, depression, suicide, mental health, flaws, complex relationships, and overall the diverse and range emotions of human struggles. It’s realistic, poignant and gives a thorough feeling. It makes the reading a fictional escape but still resonates with tough realities that make the reading experience all the more realistic and relatable. And The Wedding People should’ve been that. Instead, it falls as a cliché tale of a girl who overcomes her suicidal ideation in pretty much one day to less than a week with absolutely no struggles whatsoever. And I’m not about that bullshit.\n\nI’m all for using humor as a coping mechanism. I do it, too. I’m all for using humor as a way to deal with the harsh realities of life; of using it to paint a more raw portrayal of the struggles of mental health; of using humor to combat the physical and mental struggles of suicide thoughts and depression. But what I’m not for is using suicide as a plot device to bring in the attention of readers only to throw it out the window and add in a loose tale of a woman finding herself giving life a second chance because she…made some friends and ended up crushing on the groom/husband to be. It’s weak, ignorant, and disappointing.\n\nThere’s absolutely no feeling and emotion in this novel. The writing was a bit robotic from the start, and while it did start making sense after 40 pages or so due to how the main character, Phoebe, is feeling, it doesn’t add any more emotion as the story progresses. Phoebe doesn’t change much throughout the novel besides admitting to herself she was never going to actually kill herself to begin with because *GASP* she isn’t that type of person. How surprising. This was probably one of the weakest stories I have ever read regarding suicide and suicide attempt. The attempt was actually there. The entire execution of feelings was not, however. Adding on to that, Phoebe remains the same almost the entire way. It feels as if her character development is non existent because all there really is to her character development is the literal fact that she doesn’t want to end her life anymore. There’s no growth or even remorse. The concept of suicide in this “laugh out loud” novel is entirely shortened. We just end up in a boring, character driven story of a woman as she proceeds in life for that whole week.\n\nLila’s character is absurdly immature. I could not believe this grown woman was actually getting married. If she’s getting married, does that mean there’s hope for some of us out there? Just kidding! I don’t wanna get married! And honestly this novel has reaffirmed my decision on that. You cannot trust anyone. And as much as I didn’t like Lila, her relationship with Gary is definitely hanging on my a thread, with absolutely no going back and saving it because it was never loyal to begin with. This novel doesn’t show anything good for love. It just shows the negative sides of marriage, in my opinion. There’s no love and loyalty throughout anyone.\n\nI don’t know what I was supposed to feel, but humor and emotion are not words I’d use to describe this weak voice at all. Apparently this was dark for some readers but not for me. It was weak, boring, and so underdeveloped. The tenses change between the past and present in a way, showing how and why Phoebe gets to where she is. And honestly, the concept of this is original and I don’t think it had been done before, but the issue is that the way the author started it isn’t how she follows through. I wish she had kept it going the sarcastic lit fic way, where we follow a mentally unwell woman who is multilayered and complex. Instead we continue learning more and more about her life, her failing marriage and ex-husband, what he did. There is absolutely nothing else that adds to Phoebe’s feelings and sadness besides her broken relationship with her ex-husband and how he cheated on her. Literally. That’s it. That’s what made her book the hotel room so she can kill herself. And some may say there’s more to it, but is there really? Even as we’re learning about her past and sad life, it all circles back to her husband—how they haven’t had sex, how he hasn’t complimented her, how he cheated on her, how they haven’t gone out together, how he hasn’t looked at her, etc, etc,. I mean, sure sure, there’s more to it, but that way *I* saw it, it’s mostly tied into her failing marriage. So many of Phoebe’s thoughts just circle back to her ex-husband. It’s so miserable and pathetic. If I’m reading a story about these heavy themes, I expect more heavy emotions.\n\nOverall, disappointed but not surprised that I didn’t enjoy this. Mostly everyone does, and seeing the hype it has been receiving, I wanted to give it a chance. Clearly that didn’t work for the best. On to the next!\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "The Wedding People by Alison Espach\nNarrated by Helen Laser\nExpected Publication Date: July 30, 2024\n\nSmart, Honest and Hopeful\n\nForty-ish Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn and checks into the most expensive room for one night. She is wearing her green dress and gold heels, so she looks the part of a wedding guest-but she isn’t there to celebrate the start of a new life-she is there to END hers.\n\nInfertility, Infidelity, Depression, Divorce and now the death of her beloved cat.\n\nThat is what has led to this tragic decision.\n\nMeanwhile, the 28 year old bride, Lila has planned the PERFECT six day wedding, booking the entire Cornwall Inn for her “once in a lifetime” event. So it “just won’t do” that there has been a mix-up which allowed one random guest to check-in-even if it was just for the first night.\n\nAnd, it’s definitely UNACCEPTABLE when she meets Phoebe and learns of her intent. NOBODY will ruin her wedding!\n\nA chance encounter, an unlikely alliance, an unexpected friendship.\n\nSometimes vulnerable people make the WRONG decisions. But, if you are lucky-you can still end up with the RIGHT outcome.\n\nThis is the kind of book that you will still be thinking about long after you finish-Especially if you are a woman of a certain age-or a certain stage of your life. And, even, if like me, you hate “sex themed” bachelorette activities, and don’t really even enjoy weddings!\n\nOf course, there are some of these things to endure in this book, and my personal preference is to read about this “well intentioned” pre-wedding fun without resorting to the unnecessary use of the more vulgar sexual terms to drive your point home-the three “C” words. They didn’t seem to fit with the more reflective conversations that characterized the rest of this story. (- .5)\n\nThe ending wasn’t completely unexpected, though it is one that I hoped for, and the wisdom of the parting words shared between Phoebe and Lila, brought a tear to my eye, and is the reason I rounded up instead of down. I will remember the story.\n\nI’m glad there wasn’t an epilogue and that the reader can envision what they think happens next…\n\n4.5 stars ⭐️\n\nI listened to the Audiobook, provided by MacMillan Audio through NetGalley, which was expertly narrated by Helen Laser who delivered a wide range of voices and accents to the diverse cast of characters! This has been optioned for film and I look forward to watching too.\n\nThe book and Audible are both available NOW!\n\nThese are my Candid thoughts.\nShow more",

        "Review 4": "Happy pub day!\n\nThank you to Netgalley and the publisher for this arc in exchange for an honest review.\n\nKennedy Ryan.. you did it again. I’m completely blown away by this woman’s powerhouse of words that emit warmth and understanding with such wisdom. Other than creating connections through relatable themes which felt like such a reassuring warm hug. This book highly emphasized why I love connecting to books than just to its characters but the essence of it, the meaningful words fused together that feels thought-provoking, the message it’s sending, the autism rep and culture in this case, the various emotions pouring from it and the love felt from it all.\n\n\n”focus on your girls. focus on yourself, but when you do think about this relationship, don't compare it to anything else, to anyone else. Draw a picture in your mind of what a future could look like and really believe this could be us. And whenever you're ready, I'm right here.”\n\n\nWhile part of me definitely would’ve preferred more romance — my rating is more so because this was much more than that. Similarly to Before I let go, this also reads more like women’s fiction with romance acting as a subplot of sorts as it was very present with alot of depth but everything else had its moment. This was a story about rediscovery, redefining your self worth, self love and sisterhood besides a second chance at love intertwined throughout it out all. This wasn’t exactly as angsty as the previous book but for sure still felt so and filled with so many emotions—especially humor.\n\n“No one is on the way to rescue you. No one is on the way to save you and your girls. At the end of the day, it's up to you. And so it is.\n\n\nKennedys capacity to create resilient and powerful women shines through in her writing and Soledad was no exception. Sol was dealt with her own tribulations as a result of years of belittlement and shame directed towards her. Men like Edward deserve a life sentence and the scum of the earth. But I loved how she always stood her ground and forged ahead even when she didn’t know what awaited her and her girls. The aspect of influencer/content creator in this would’ve been annoying in any other book but i honestly didn’t mind it here. i guess because of how it was subtly interwoven and wasn’t immaturely unbearable given that sol is a mom of 3 and finding a job as a stay at home mom feels almost impossible. So her being able to have this to help rebuild herself feel like a win to all moms that need to make a living to support her kids. Her journey in loving herself and self reflection in the woman she was versus the one she pushed herself to be felt so realistic as so many women will/have found themselves in sol’s position. So while the title is “this could be us” i also thought ”this could be me” as her journey in realizing what she deserved felt utterly commanding and I was here for it. Sol coming to terms in allowing herself to be happy with Judah by not denying her own happiness in doing so while healing was incredible to see—they were so deserving of one another.\n\n\n”When I first saw her, it felt like someone hit me in the solar plexus. Kicked me in the throat. I didn't even realize I was staring until she turned away.”\n\n\nJudah is such an incredible father and man that I’ve had the privilege to read about in a book. The way he was with sol was entirely sweet. My man was so down bad for her lol and he never gave up on giving her space to grow and love on herself on her own while reassuring her that he’ll be there all the while. He was extremely perceptive of her and everything about her and we all love a man who pays attention. The subtle chin touches, the glaring heated stares, the patience & understanding, the sizzling tension, his words, the sentiments, the support, the slow burn and this fine ass man—consider me absolutely enamored because where can i find myself a Judah??\n\n“You did not only what was best for them, you did what was good for me. So many moms lose their careers until their kids are almost grown. You didn't let that happen to me.\"\n\n\nAnd the healthy co parenting in this? Phenomenal. I loved the maturity from him and his ex and in general in this book as they were all such mature adults (except for one). Judah has two twin boys with autism and is such an attentive and present father. My heart melted during those scenes with them. I wholeheartedly loved the autism rep in this as I have a sibling with autism and have never read about it in a book—therefore it was highly validating and resonated profoundly to me. so thank you Kennedy for the accurate portrayal as being on the spectrum looks so differently for everyone and your description of both brothers reminded me of my own. For those unaware, her son is on the spectrum, so again this book highlighted one of her own experiences and it goes to show the care & attention she pours into what she writes.\n\n\n“There aren't enough sonnets for friendship. Not enough songs for the kind of love not born of blood or body but of time and care”\n\n\nThe found family here was exceptionally beautiful that I loved every interaction between them. The women here were so supportive and showed such immeasurable love to one another that it’s apparent how these are the type of women you want in your life and corner. So I’m glad that Soledad has yasmen and Hendrix—the true embodiment of friends turned family. Also love the inclusion of scenes we got between sol and her sisters as well. All throughout the book you begin to notice how each of them played a role in sol’s journey in self love and rediscovery. Brief mention but the nostalgia she felt with her mother and all the references mentioned truly touched me beyond measure.\n\nLastly, I couldn’t end this without mentioning how kennedy is one of those authors that properly does her research because Soledad is Afro-Latina and the Puerto Rican representation in this?! I’m impressed and wanted to cry lol I’ve never seen this representation in a book and every reference felt entirely familiar and brought a genuine smile to my face. Idk if this book was perfect but I do know it was beautiful and will forever hold a special place in my heart for different reasons.\n\nExtremely thankful I was able to read soledads book early on and as expected I loved and will forever cherish it 🥹 I can’t wait for Kennedy to bless us with Hendrix’s book as her humor never failed to entertain me lol Kennedy had jokes. **I doubt she’ll see this but as this is going to be a film someday—someone please tell her to think about casting Tasha smith as Hendrix as I just know she’ll kill it**\n\nI highlighted so much on my kindle but these are just a few quotes I loved:\n\n“When conversing with the heart, expect it to talk back, to revisit the pains and disappointments that left the deepest dents and scratches.”\n\n“I could tell her everything that interests her interests me because it’s a clue to how I can reach her, how I can love her the way she deserves”\n\n“Do you have to deny yourself happiness with someone else in order to be happy with yourself?”\n\n“When are we ever done working on ourselves? I believe wholeness is not a destination, but a lifetime process. Something that instead of waiting for, you could be living for.”\n\n“Like always, just the touch of our hands sends a thrill through me, as if our hearts meet and beat between our palms.”\n\n—-\nWhoever has read Before I let go, NetGalley currently has the arc as *read now until tomorrow* 🙌🙌 can’t wait to start soledad’s book 🥹\nShow more",

        "Review 6": "4.5⭐️ I need to read more books like this!! ❤️\n\nIn my head, contemporary romance is a genre that's like the complete opposite of fantasy haha I don't know if I'm right on that or not, but let's assume I'm right in the context of this review . There is contemporary romance and contemporary romance written by Kennedy Ryan 💖💖\n\nBecause her fmcs are from all walks of life and empowering while being real and experiencing real issues. For the most part, we read to live in worlds that we wish were real because they are pretty amazing but contemporary romance tells me real life is hard but can also be amazing.\n\nIt is great to see how personal this story was to Kennedy, a mother and woman taking charge of her own life and firmly at the center of her own story as well as her experience with a child on the autism spectrum. I thought this was a solid plot and beautiful story. I love that her stories always, always, always have emotional depth to them. Probably the only thing I miss was that I wanted to see how Edward would fit into the story after everything happened and that part felt a bit rushed but I'm happy about how everything worked out for Soledad. 💞💞💞\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "2.75/5 stars\n\nThank you so much for the ARC!!! <3\n\n(I always do long reviews for ARCs, so here we go :))\n\nAww man i really wanted to like this 😭. So far most of the Kennedy Ryan books I have read I have loved, so I was really shocked when i got to the end of this and kinda sat there like :/. The beginning started off so strong too, and I was really looking forward to reading about an older couple (also the plot twist with Edward had my mouth dropping open because it was so left field and I was EATING it upppp) I also really liked Before I let go, so the hopes with this one were HIGH.\n\nI also lovedddd the autism representation, as that is super rare in books and I feel like Kennedy really showcased how to do research on something and showcased it well in her book!\n\nHowever.....\n\nFor me, Soledad and Judah had zero chemistry. Like completely nonexistent. I'm not sure if its because Soledad was pushing this whole self love journey so hard, (which is perfectly fine, but the romance plot line to me felt secondary and came up short) or there was just too much about her being an influencer and other random plot points, but I just could not dive into the romance like at all. I also really disliked Soledad (I'm sorry 😭) but to me her 'self love' quickly turned...selfish (I know this is a hot take but it was her actions toward Judah for me)– and the way she almost just like...played in Judahs face??? Hello?? Why would you lead him on if you wanna dive into your 'self love' journey only to turn around and be like \"You don't want me no more??\" THE ICKKKKKKK IMMEDIATELY. The spice also made me cringe im not going to lie.\n\nLike this book very much read like this:\n1. We learn who Soledad is and about her marriage\n2. We learn what happens with her and her ex-husband + how it affects her daughters\n2.5. Random plot points about her mom + Bell Hooks that leads no where\n3. Her influencer career for random spurts and how she wants to focus on herself\n4. Oh yeah and poor Judah is just existing and trying to love her?? 😭\n\nAlso we get like...nothing about Judah imo. Or maybe not enough? I just felt like i had no clue who this man was, and his entire personality was being in an FBI accountant with glasses he only used to read. We get like a few ins to him and Tremaine and that was VERYYYY refreshing to read about and how well they got along which i loved..but that was basically it?\n\nLike I really tried yall, because in a way i understood where Soledad was coming from, and that they are a bit in the older range (40s) so they don't really have time to be take 10 years on a self love journey. Self love isn't always the basic self care things we think it is, and it looks different as more things enter your life like kids, marriages, friendships, etc.– So i can understand and I get that Soledad was really trying to stay a float and find herself, but to me thats not an excuse to play in others feelings 😭 . Tbh it gave very much fake influencer energy, where they preach that they are doing this that and the third (#datingmyself in this book) ...only to be basically lying LMAOOOO (aka shes in Judahs face??). I gotta keep it a stack– I reallllllly disliked the influencer plot line, it just all seemed very random and coincidental. She was a good cook??? But an influencer??? Got 2 million followers? But also liked cleaning??? But also hosted events??? It was all just a jumbled random mess to me.\n\nAll in all, I really liked the representation, the plot twist in the beginning, and I LOVE how Kennedy Ryan writes, but this just wasn't the story for me. 💔\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "5/5 ⭐️\n\n- Wow!! This book was everything!! The themes of self love and learning to stand on your own were such a large part of the book which I loved!! We need more books like this about independent women learning to love life on their own terms. Such an empowering story that I absolutely devoured.\n- There are so many great quotes in this book and it would be the best pick for a book club!! The plot was so unique and I loved the autism representation that you don’t see often in books. I love that their story spanned over a year and that it was dual pov because the reader really gets to see them build a friendship that turns into something more.\n- I love a man that can be soft when he needs to be and take charge when he needs to do that too. Judah was perfect!! The garage scene.. whew!!\n- This book felt like the romance was almost more of a subplot which I normally wouldn’t enjoy, but I LOVED the way it was written in this story. You could really see that Soledad was putting herself first! It’s so easy for us to put anything and everything above our own healing journey, but this book really focused so much on solo dating and finding who you are while falling in love. I already can’t wait to read it again!\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "4 stars\n\nI love starting the year with a winner. Kennedy Ryan is that author for me. The one who makes me feel too much. I’d read any book by her knowing I’d be fully emotionally invested. This one was no exception.\n\nI love how freakin strong her women are. Soledad strength and how she was learning how to love and put herself first was so inspiring. Judah was just as sweet and caring as all of Kennedy’s heroes. I loved seeing him with Soledad and how he’d always put her priorities first. I loved seeing him with his kids and how he was such an amazing caring father. The book was just so beautiful and informational.\n\nI love that Kennedy always includes important topics in her romances, but I guess in this one it kinda overshadowed the romance? Don’t get me wrong I love when she does that. It always makes me more invested and makes the story feel more emotional. It’s just that with this one it kinda started to feel more like a women fiction? And this is not exactly a bad thing. I still loved the book and was totally invested in the story. I just wanted more romantic moments between them? Also, I wanted to see more of how the thing with her daughter was resolved. Overall, This felt like a great, sensible, teaching me lessons read for the start of the year. I loved before I let go more (even when it left me emotionally drained), but this was still a good read.\n\nHuge Thanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for providing this copy.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "I was also impressed with how Kennedy Ryan masterfully master-mixed the women's fiction and romance in the narrative, making sure the romance was not the star, yet complimentary. It was like we are theater-goers watching humans live and interact with love, not love in the narrative in and of itself. Her expertise in storytelling and narrative strongly demonstrates here.\nAudibook Version: \"This Could Be Us\" by Kennedy Ryan\n\nFor anyone who seeks well-crafted and captivating fiction that transcends the romantic format, I would recommend picking up this novel. Kennedy Ryan is a master storyteller and she delivers a poignant, beautifully constructed, love, resiliency, and personal empowerment.\n\nThe book conducts a guided tour of the carnage, while at the same time casting a bright light on Soledad's path to healing - mentally, emotionally, financially, and eventually, finally, sexually. Her strength, and the laborious work she commits to herself and her three daughters in order to be whole, is palpable.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "This was my first novel by Sally Rooney, and I loved it.\n\nUnwittingly, I prepared myself well for Intermezzo by first launching into James Joyce's Ulysses, which I had never read before. (Yes, I know. Shame on me, and an English teacher, too!) It was immediately striking how much Joyce's narrative techniques had affected Rooney's own writing (and of course, many other writers inside and outside Ireland). It's clear Rooney is well-versed in the literary traditions from which she draws, and to which she contributes beautifully. Without having first read Joyce, though, I might have had trouble wading into the chapters told from Peter's perspective, which are Joycean in their stream of consciousness use of voice, the density of their paragraphs, and their paucity of punctuation. Once you get used to the style, the story flows quite easily, but if you are used to breezy narratives with lots of line breaks and straightforward prose, this may take a bit of effort to adjust to. The payoff is more than worth it.\n\nThe story alternates between two brothers, Peter and Ivan, who could not be more different, and yet whose life-journeys mirror one another and conflict with one another as only siblings' lives can. Peter is a lawyer, outwardly successful, inwardly damaged by his relationship with the love of his life (SPOILER) who can no longer be physically intimate because of constant pain following a car accident. Peter finds himself in a new relationship with a much younger woman -- a relationship that may or may not be contractual -- but which seems impossible to reconcile with his feelings for his old lover. The death of Peter's father, the last thing that tied him and his brother together, threatens to send Peter over the edge of despair.\n\nMeanwhile, younger brother Ivan, a struggling chess player, becomes inadvertently involved with an older woman. Is it love? Is it just for fun? Is it possible to have a true equal romantic partnership with someone when there is more than a decade between you? These are the questions Rooney explores as we follow Ivan and Peter through their trauma, grief, mutual resentment, and romantic entanglements. I was deeply affected by the characters' struggles. There are no easy heroes and villains here, just people struggling along as best they can, trying to make something out of imperfect lives. There is beautiful prose, steamy romance, lovely character building, and a sense of realness to the plot that made me care. In short, a stunning novel that I'm glad I read. I will be on the lookout for more from Rooney!\n\n\nShow more",

        "Review 3": "this book was the most exciting news of my year and i got engaged the week it was announced.\n\nsomehow, it still exceeded my life-altering, world-centering, unrealistic-to-the-point-of-being-annoying expectations.\n\nwith every book, sally rooney seems to challenge herself in a new way, showing that in the years since her last release while we've all been pining and watching paul mescal fan edits she's been ever (somehow! still!) building on her craft. in beautiful world, where are you, for example, she displayed a totally new and mesmerizing use of visual language and natural motif that i fell in love with.\n\nhere, her use of perspective is stunning. i'm a multi-pov hater, but this manages to feel like something entirely different even as it follows the interiority of three characters. it seamlessly transitions between the three while still being vividly distinct: peter's staccato trains of thought, margaret's quiet self-reflection, ivan's anxious rambling. i've never read anything like it.\n\ndecisions like the little we see from within the two female characters in peter's orbit, and are immersed in the world of ivan's, feels so true to their characters and to their stories — and such an interesting facet to the characteristic sociopolitical explorations that are the true gem of rooney's writing.\n\nrooney also challenges herself to create characters who are simultaneously unlikable and real, making decisions that threaten to get you to put the book down and sigh while being mercilessly relatable and easy to understand.\n\nthat's what we're working with here. a novel in which every choice is so thoughtful that you can spend a minute reading a page, then pause for five minutes just to consider it. which is basically what i did (read: make myself spend a month reading this because i so dreaded not having any more of it to draw out).\n\npeter and ivan each represent a shade of misogyny, of straight-white-man-ism in modern society, that doesn't forgive itself even while it refuses to let you ignore their own humanity and histories.\n\npeter's perspective, made up of brief ulyssean phrases and stunning descriptions, varies as much from ivan's terminally introspective one as the two brothers do from each other. \n\nrooney's past books have focused on waxing and waning romantic (and semi-romantic) relationships; beautiful world also features a platonic one at its core. this one takes as its subject siblings, at first nearly estranged, as they struggle toward each other.\n\nanyway. i often hate multiple perspectives because it always feels there's one the author is more comfortable with, that the choice to distinguish the two is because they have to be different because they're different characters. rooney's decision is deliberate, each perspective difference thought out, and because of that both are wildly impressive.\n\ni loved this book.\n\nbottom line: all the it girls love intermezzo and all the it girls are right.\n\n(thank you from the bottom of my heart to the publisher for the arc)\n(buddy read of a lifetime with my favorite girl elle)\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Despite Rooney’s books being largely about nothing, with the plot consisting of basically sad people being sad, I never before found them slow or boring. I found the characters and situations in Normal People and Beautiful World tragic enough to keep me glued to the pages. I can’t say I enjoyed them, but I was definitely engaged.\n\nIntermezzo, unfortunately, dragged in parts. Rooney’s books are getting longer and longer and I think in this one (448 pages, compared to NP's 273 and BW's 337) I finally reached my limit for melancholy navel-gazing.\n\nThat's not to say I didn't get something out of it. I still really enjoyed the character portraits. Rooney is good at taking fucked up relationship dynamics and exploring them up, down and inside out. Here she looks not only at complex romantic entanglements, but also the relationship between two very different brothers who are struggling to connect with each other and manage their grief after their father's death.\n\nI like that she dramatically changes writing style when she moves between Peter and Ivan’s perspectives, reflecting their personalities in Peter’s rapidfire, often meandering, thoughts and Ivan’s more precisely-articulated inner narrative.\n\nHowever, I never fully enjoyed the inclusion of Margaret’s perspective in Ivan’s chapters and still can't really understand the decision behind it. All it did was give us less page time with Ivan, making Peter, ultimately, the more developed character and the more interesting POV to read.\n\nI also felt like Peter's ending was too easily wrapped up. He's in a very complex situation and spends the whole book moping (some of it justified; some of it less so) but then solutions just seem to start falling into his lap without any growth on his part.\n\nNot my favourite, but let's be honest: I'm going to read whatever she writes next.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "4.5. WOW. sally rooney has such a talent for writing about interpersonal relationships and human connection, and it’s something i’ll never tire of reading.\n\nintermezzo is the story of two brothers: peter, a successful lawyer in his thirties who is juggling relationships with two different women, and his younger brother ivan, a competitive chess player in his early twenties who begins a relationship with an older woman he meets at one of his tournaments.\n\nit’s hard to talk in depth about this book for fear of spoiling it, but it definitely feels like a step forwards for sally rooney as a literary fiction author. intermezzo contains a much deeper character study into its two protagonists, exploring their family dynamics and how they grapple with navigating their brotherhood in the shadow of their father’s recent death. the scope of the novel feels wider; you really feel like you know these characters and why they are the way they are, why they act the way they do.\n\nintermezzo also has rooney’s trademark political zest: commentary on wage labour, the housing crisis in dublin, monetary power dynamics, religion, existentialism, and discussions of chronic pain (to name a few). another thing i’ve always liked about sally rooney’s novels is how she talks about the internet / social media. it’s present in her books, as it needs to be when writing about young characters navigating the contemporary world, but it’s never too much. her awareness of social media, coupled with her lack of (public) personal accounts, conjures the image of rooney lurking on the periphery of the internet somewhere. she is also a master of dialogue, perfectly weaving in all the intricacies and subtleties of human conversation.\n\nall this to say, it’s another hit from sally rooney & further cements her as my favourite author! (but who’s surprised). thank you SO much @faberbooks for the advanced copy, i’m forever indebted. intermezzo is out on 24 sept 2024!\n\n—————————\n\nupdate: i got the arc!!! i will be devouring it asap so stay tuned\n\nsally rooney hive we are so back\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "In a deliberately quiet almost hissing voice Ivan says: I actually hate you. I’ve hated you my entire life.\nWithout stirring, without looking around to see whether the other diners or staff are watching them, Peter just answers: I know.\n\n\nhate when i dislike a book and go to read negative reviews but none of them hate it for any reason that even remotely resembles my sentiments. “It’s just people talking for four hundred pages” the fuck do you want? explosions? go watch a marvel movie.\n\n\nrooney stuns with a writing that has never been this distinctive in her works before. the change in writing style between pov chapters brilliant. peter’s short, rapid fired, sometimes incoherent thoughts the best part. (of course most will hate and criticise this stylistic choice cause in the booktok age of reading experimentation is a big no-no)\n\nbut quite frankly style is the only thing i liked with this one.\n\n\nthe ivan/margaret chapters (and why on earth were the ivan chapters mostly from margaret’s point of view anyway? i thought this was supposed to be about the brothers?) feel like reading about a twelve year old falling in love with an adult. ivan just does not read like a 22 year old at all. making this age gap relationship more cringe and at times simply unbearable than the actually very mundane thing that it is. i guess ivan is supposed to be on some kind of autistic spectrum but i find his portrayal highly questionable.\n\npeter’s chapters while more emotionally complex simply don’t go anywhere. his inner turmoil doesn’t really reach its climax and instead he gets an out of nowhere saccharine ending where everything gets handed to him on a silver platter and we have to pretend that he’s conflicted about that for the last five pages like yeah, woe is him.\n\n\noverall, this book might have profited from a harsher editing with the ivan chapters especially being way too long and dragging on unnecessarily. somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.\n\n\n- - -\n\nusually depressive episodes hit me by surprise but i'm glad to know that i can plan one for september\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Under the guise of ambitious prose that aims to contribute to the discussion on grief lies a book about two brothers complaining about life and banging inappropriate women.\n\nWhile Ivan's (the younger brother's) storyline is somewhat readable, Peter's (the older brother's) arc is an utterly unbearable narrative mess that promotes toxic patterns. Both storylines feature criminally underdeveloped, two-dimensional female characters. In short, the entire book is over-intellectualized, offers no deeper reflections, and simultaneously provides a deceptively happy ending. The pacing is good, but that’s no advantage.\n\nI’m sad to conclude that Sally Rooney’s novels are getting worse with each new release. One should truly draw the line and stop reading them.\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "When I heard that there was going to be a spin-off from the Shark’s Edge Series, I was over the damn moon. Anyone that knows me, knows how much I loved that series and all the amazing characters in it. I was devastated saying goodbye when the series ended. When I saw it was Hannah’s sisters that were getting their own books, I was so happy! I was intrigued by them and wanted to know more about them when they appeared in Elijah and Hannah’s books!\n\nThis is book one in the Bombshells of Brentwood series and it can be read as a standalone. This is Agatha and Carmen’s story and it starts with them in Vegas for Agatha’s sister, Hannah’s wedding. But after drinking WAY TOO MUCH, Agatha and Carmen (Hannah’s husband's assistant and friend) wake up married too rather than getting it annulled, they have decided that they will stay together, move in together and give the marriage ago for the next 12 months.\n\nCarmen and Agatha were complete opposites. They couldn’t be more opposite if they tried! He was very stable, dependable, secure, worked extremely hard at his job and liked to live his life very organised, whereas Agatha was very impulsive and a hot mess 99% of the time, but I love Agatha wholeheartedly. My heart hurts for her also. She has been through a lot and is someone I can relate to and I’m sure others will too. Understandably, she is the way she is and as the story develops, you can see there is significant growth within her character.\n\nThese two together were opposites, yes, but they also balanced each other out in a way. Even though they started this entire relationship backwards and got married first, Carmen was good for Agatha, I think he was exactly what she needed to settle her down. I even liked the moments things weren’t hearts and flowers and these two did fight, it made them even more relatable! It was made obvious that these two were meant to be together. The undeniable desire, connection and chemistry was intoxicating and was there throughout the book and the passion and heat was sizzling hot!\n\n\nOverall, I loved Carmen and Agatha’s story so much. There was so much character growth and development throughout the book and crazy enough, this is my first ‘Married After a Drunk Night in Vegas’ book I’ve ever read and I loved it. It was different to what I’m used to. The storyline was so easy to get lost in and I most definitely will be rereading this! Victoria Blue is a master of her craft and has delivered an extremely well-written, outstanding, emotionally charged, all-consuming, addictive, unputdownable story.\n\nI can’t wait for Mentoring Maye!

        "Review 2": "Book review for accepting Agatha by @missvictoriablu I got a copy of this book of BookFunnel and I really didn’t know what the story about was about when I choose to read this book I just like the flower on the cover and the title of the book. So this is a story about two people that had to come together due to the facts that his boss and her sister were getting marry in LAS Vegas aka party city and a place where nobody sleeps.So at first I thought they were going to get a divorced because they were in Vegas and you know the saying what happen in Vegas stay in Vegas but this time didn’t count because they woke up marry she was freaking out and I would do if I were in her shoes after waking up in a bed with a stranger. So they leave Vegas and head home now they both come from a family that have a lot of view on any matter of both of their life’s so she didn’t want to tell anybody what happened but at the end I think only his boss and her sister and his sister knew what happened. This pilot in the book was an great read because it was truly a love story waiting to happen till the very end of the book like you didn’t know where this was going because of everything that happened in the book. I don’t want to say that much without giving certain things away. I would recommend this book I give a 5 star reviews.",
        "Review 3": "I was generously gifted this book in exchange for my honest review. This was my first book that I've read by Victoria Blue, but I can tell you that it won't be the last. I am a sucker for a good love story, but I go crazy for a love story that has complex characters, and this book definitely supplied that! I've read other books that have done the drunken night in Vegas turns into becoming married, but most have turned into a romantic comedy or a marriage that was planned and orchestrated by one of the main characters (9 times out of 10 times the MMC). But this definitely wasn't a romantic comedy, nor would I place it in the dark romance category. This was such a complex contemporary romance. Normally, in most stories, it's the female main character that. is the more emotionally mature and stable one, but in this book, that was the complete opposite. Agatha was a bit of a hot mess, but Carmen was so patient with her and was so invested in her and wanting to make their marriage work and trying to help Agatha in multiple ways. I was so invested in their relationship and their dynamic and was practically enthralled from start to finish with them!! I cannot wait to read what comes in the next book, Mentoring Maye.

They actually bring out the best in each other and I love watching their love bloom. I need more of their story.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "What happens when polar opposites get drunkenly hitched in Vegas? Carmen is a straight-laced Catholic with his life very by-the-book. Agatha is impulsive, living vivaciously and uncommitted; with nights filled with drinking and hook-ups she's struggling to keep her professional life together.\n\nIndividually each character was okay, I found Agatha to be a likeable underdog in her storyline. Once they come together I thought Carmen was intolerable and Agatha was a pushover. They each have back stories that explain some of their behaviors. They're polar opposites and the relationship is just fighting and sex.\n\nThe story held my attention, was easy to read, and I needed to see what happened. However Carmen's character left an icky feeling I'm not sure I'll continue with this series. My biggest issue with this story was: at no point was I ever rooting for this couple to stay together.\n\nThank you to LuvBooks and Waterhouse Press for an advanced copy.

        "Review 6": "4 ✨\n\nTropes:\n\n♡ Accidental marriage\n♡ Friends to lovers\n♡ He falls first (and HARD)\n♡ Forced proximity\n♡ Opposites attract\n\nSaying that Agatha and Carmen are complete opposites is honestly an understatement, but in a way they were such a perfect fit. Isn’t that what you say that opposites attract? That’s certainly the case with these two. I love a good drunken marriage in Vegas romance but this one was so different from anything I had read before in that genre and totally not in a bad way at all.\n\nIn most romances where the main characters end up marriage after a wild night in Vegas, they want to get it annulled by somehow end up staying together but this is not the case with Accepting Agatha. Carmen and Agatha are attending the wedding of her big sister and his boss in Las Vegas and just had the wildest night ever. The morning after they wake up in the same bed not only together but also married with two green rubber rings on their ring fingers. Agatha immediately wants to get an annulment but Carmen doesn’t. He’s raised catholic and therefore don’t want to get a divorce/annulment and he’s also head over heels with Agatha so he wants to give their marriage a chance. Therefore Carmen asks Agatha to give him a year to see if this marriage is sustainable and something that could turn into the real deal.\n\nEven though they were complete opposites when it comes to their way of thinking and their personalities, they still somehow balanced each other out so well. Agatha is what you could call a a hot mess 99% of the time, she’s very impulsive and emotional where Carmen is stable and secure in himself and what he wants. Agatha also just lost her job and moving in with Carmen and being a new space is kinda hard for her. Carmen is very protective and wants the best for her and that is one of the ways I think he balances her out so well. But Agatha is also a free spirited person so she contributes to Carmen with that and learns him how to be more laid back and relaxed.\n\nOverall I loved this book so much because we got a ton of character development and such a solid and sweet love story about how love can form after marriage, which is very controversial in real life but not in books if you ask me! I can’t wait for Mentoring Maye next!\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Accepting Agatha, book one of the new series Bombshells of Brentwood, by Victoria Blue-\nRating: 3 ⭐️\n\nThis is the first book I’ve read by Victoria Blue. It is a contemporary romance that focuses on Carmen and Agatha, who wake up and find themselves married after a night out in Vegas.\n\nThe plot and storyline were decent but it is a story I’m familiar with. (Married in Vegas after a drunken night out.) Carmen works for Agatha’s sisters husband. While in Vegas for her sisters wedding, they find themselves married as well. Rather than get an annulment, they decide to move in together and give the marriage a year…\n\nWhat makes this story interesting is the dynamic between Carmen and Agatha. Honestly, she’s a hot mess. I didn’t feel very drawn to her character. She was all over the place and not very emotionally stable or mature. She had volatile outbursts, often, pouted like a petulant child and wasn’t very responsible. Carmen, on the other hand, was a saint in comparison. He was very emotionally evolved and exercised extreme control, restraint and patience when dealing with Agatha. He was responsible and carried himself with dignity. Maybe he liked “fixing” Agatha? She was a challenge? Or maybe it was that he was extremely attracted her and they had great sex. (There are some really steamy scenes within these pages.) Carmen’s demeanor seemed to have a grounding effect on Agatha and they made it work.\n\nThe end was pretty anticlimactic. Agatha seemed to have decided to try harder and open up emotionally to Carmen and he was more than pleased with that, both found they were falling for the other, despite their chaotic start in marriage.\n\nThree stars because while I found this book to be a bit boring, it was still written decently and it isn’t a bad book by any means. It just wasn’t exciting enough, or plot heavy enough for me.\n\nThank you to LuvBooks for sending me the paperback in exchange for my honest review.\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "This book was not for me. I have a lot of thoughts, but to keep this short, Carmen is probably the most toxic MMC I've ever read. The entire relationship between Carmen and Agatha is extraordinarily unhealthy. Agatha has some things to figure out but deserves someone actually compassionate.",
        "Review 9": "I hate Carmen. I think he’s annoying and judgey and manipulative. Agatha has her issues, but honestly I think she is way more loveable than Carmen. This book was well written but I just couldn’t get behind the characters. There was something about this relationship that didn’t work for me. Carmen didn’t actually listen to Agatha. There were so many times when she was basically screaming for help or she would open up to him and he would just ignore it and change the subject. And then he had the audacity to get mad when she didn’t want to share with him.\n\nAgatha was immature and definitely had issues, but I think she was someone so many people could relate to. I think her issues were understandable. I wish the book went more into her history and gave more context as to why she was the way she was. I think she deserved more of an explanation instead of coming off as a brat.\n\nOverall, I think I just needed more from this book. The ending was abrupt and the characters never really fully developed.\nShow more",

        "Review 2": "I rarely write reviews, but this book feels like a personal insult to readers’ intelligence and ethics.\n\nI first heard about Let Them on Oprah’s show, where it was praised as one of the best books she'd ever read. Intrigued by the endorsement, I gave it a try—and quickly regretted my decision.\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room: this idea is far from revolutionary. Philosophers like the Stoics—and countless others—have articulated this concept for centuries: accept what you must, control what you can, and make empowered choices rooted in reality. Packaging this timeless wisdom as a “theory” feels not only gimmicky but borderline disrespectful to the rich history of these teachings.\n\nBut the real problem is deeper. Let Them borrows heavily—if not entirely—from a poem by Cassie Phillips, shared online long before Mel's viral video. In that video, Mel casually mentions she \"heard something\" before launching into what is essentially Let Them, the poem. Instead of properly crediting the original author, Mel parlayed the phrase into a book deal and, shockingly, fabricated a story on Oprah, claiming the concept was inspired by her daughter's reaction—a cascade of \"Let Them(s)\". This blatant erasure of Cassie Phillips is unacceptable.

This isn’t the first time she’s used a dramatic backstory to sell a book, but this time, the cracks are glaring. The result is a shallow, ego-driven cash grab, devoid of nuance and authenticity. It’s another reminder that hype often overshadows substance, and popularity doesn’t equate to originality.\n\nI’m astonished this book was published. It’s a stark example of how far opportunism can go when the spotlight blinds accountability.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "This is the worst book that I will read in 2025. I can write this with confidence - in January - because it is one of the worst books I have read in my life, and I have just turned 56.\n\nIf you want to understand how Donald Trump became President... If you want to understand why there is a focus on influencers rather than intelligent people who know what they are doing... If you want to understand the decontexualization of poverty or homelessness... Then this is your book.\n\nWhat is happening? Let's do this...\n\nWe have an under-performing, under-educated woman summoning under-refereed research to offer a commentary about life. Her own life has been punctuated by a series of failures. Yet she then uses these failures from her husband and children to create a 'theory.'\n\nPlease note: the word 'theory' is used in the title. This is not a 'theory'. What is offered is a vibe. An opinion. A data set of one. The idea that readers know so little that this vibe is accepted as a theory - shows why we are in the mess we are in...\n\nLet's present some evidence about this book... Which is what this book does not do.\n\nHere are the edited highlights of this book:\n\n“How I changed my life”\n\n“I knew I wanted to teach the 5 second rule full time and somehow make this my career, but I didn’t know how. l Looking back, I can see how paralysed I was with imposter syndrome. What right did I have to call myself an expert in anything?”\n\n“When people would ask if I had a Ph.D or if I was a therapist, I would say, “No, I learned everything the hard way – by screwing up my own life and then having to fix it”\n\n“I’ve been told over and over again that I have this amazing ability to distill complex ideas and scientific research into simple, actionable advice that anyone can use to improve their life”\n\n“I have made it my mission to find and share many simple tools to help anyone create a better life”\n\n“The truth is, other people hold no real power over you unless you give it to them”\n\n“No matter what is happening … you still hold the power”\n\n“People do what they feel like doing”\n\n“Let Them struggle”\n\n\"Chris [her husband] had developed a major problem with alcohol. He was drinking away the stress and engaging in other self-destructive behaviors. He was depressed, anxious, and knew he could no longer live like this”\n\n“I was speaking to my therapist, Anne, about this.”\n\n“You have the power.\"\n\n“You can have the life you’ve always wanted. You can be a millionaire.”\n\n“No one else can stop you. It’s all on you.”\n\nMy new t-shirt slogan in life is - things could be worse. You could be Chris. You could be married to Mel Robbins and have your life, and your weaknesses and fears presented in a truly rubbish self help book.\n\nOn behalf of all the people who have lost their lives through homelessness, grief, tragedy and death, you know what, Mel? Sometimes, we don't have the power. Sometimes, we don't want to be a millionaire. Sometimes, we have been treated like rubbish by late capitalism and lost our lives, our love, our hopes, our future.\n\nLet them in not a theory. It is nonsense. It is a vibe. She has thrown her own family under a bus to offer an opinion.\n\nThis book is a warning for academics. Actual scholars. Not #randoms doing Ted talks. If we do not disseminate our research widely and appropriately, a mediocre woman whose career highlight is a Ted talk and an Oprah interview will end up offering advice to the next generation.\n\nLet's not - Let Them. Let's commit to research. Let's commit to theory. Let's commit to interpretation. Let's commit to ideas beyond an individual. Let's understand history and geography and meaning.\n\nLet us be defiant scholars. Who believe in the world. Not rehashing the stories of one woman and her family.\n\nChris - we're with you.\nShow more",

        "Review 5": "I willingly picked up a self help book, shocking I know.\n\nI definitely can see why so many people love this book. It’s got a catchy tag line and it’s giving “the subtle art if not giving a f*ck” vibes. If you’re struggling with your relationships, whether that be friends, family, coworkers, or romantic, then this book may be helpful to you.\n\nFor me, I found this book pretty repetitive. I also think in theory “let them” sounds nice but I found a lot of flaws in it. Aside from that I must say I am biased here because I personally hate self help books. To me they give the same energy as 35-45 year old woman sharing “inspiring” quotes on Facebook. I don’t know how else to explain it, but if you get it, you get it. Also on top of that, I don’t find them enlightening. Does anyone really learn something ground breaking from a self help book or is it information you kinda already knew?\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "When I was starting this book, I saw that Oprah said this is the best self help book (in idk how long) - and I thought - wow, that’s probably a bit of a stretch…\nBut, nope ! This really is one of the best in general, and definitely the best personal development book I have read in years!!\nIt has so many lessons and takeaways that I actually can not really even digest them all right now. I’ll have to come back to the book, highlight and re-read and take it all in.\n\nApart from being full of excellent and freeing advice, it felt like this huge therapy session! I felt comforted, understood, seen, like I was given tools and directions! Like, this wasn’t some theories and empty talk book that you read and have no idea how to actually apply anything from it.. It was practical, actionable, doable!\n\nMel is also so incredibly vulnerable and honest, and her ability to show up as this flawed person and still show love and kindness for herself, and the fact that *I* see her faults and still like her - it really gives you proof and permission to be just as you are. To accept and forgive that previous version, to know and express you have issues and have made mistakes - but does not make you any less lovable or less of a person.\nThis whole book serves as a reminder that the best is yet to come, that we really do - live and learn -\nand that every new day, no matter our age or situation; is the opportunity to choose better for ourselves and those around us.\n\nA perfect book to start the new year with & one I’ll be recommending over and over again!\nThank you, Mel, this was incredible and so full of value !!! 🩷\nShow more",

I’ve had a few experiences recently where men have said I need to smile more or stop nagging (at work) or being bossy, and I wonder if there is something wrong with me.\n\nThis book made my anger feel validated. I love therapy for this in that you can learn that your feelings aren’t uncommon across others. This does the same thing.\n\nSo many of the examples are kind of no brainers for women. We’ve all had countless experiences the same or similar to those in the book. They’re not a surprise but they still invoke anger, disgust and sadness that we are still dealing with these issues.\n\nI think of all the women in my life when I read this, my friends, my mum, and want to pass it along to them and learn their takeaways.

        "Review 1": "When I look at my early highlights, I'm reminded of why I thought this book was heading for 4+ stars: solid, practical insights in abundance, many of which were the best kind of insight, the kind that make you smack yourself in the forehead because they're blindingly obvious once they're pointed out, or because you knew whatever-it-was all along but keep managing to forget it.\n\nHere, have a few:\n- cuddling after sex is the best predictor of sexual satisfaction\n- if your partner's not interested in sex, maybe take some of the housework (or whatever) off their plate so they're less tired and stressed\n- 'The idea of a “skilled” lover is a myth; unless you’re trying technically demanding BDSM practice like breath play, the only “skill” you need is the ability to pay attention to your partner and to your own internal experience at the same time.' <-- This one might be my personal favorite, though there's plenty of technically demanding BDSM besides breathplay, like please practice your aim if you want to do any significant impact play, okay?\n- Don't assume! That's my summation of a number of Nagoski's points: don't assume your partner wants or needs to come; don't assume that \"anal play\" necessarily entails (see what I did there?) penetration; don't assume that sex has to take any particular form to be enjoyable.\n\nI have quibbles with some of these nuggets, like the one about urgency being the enemy of pleasure. Hasty sex can be smoking hot, come on. To be fair, though, one of Nagoski's throughlines is the difference between spontaneous desire (\"I'm so horny!\") and responsive desire (\"Oh, hey, this is getting good to me, let's keep going!\"), and as a rule, when you've been together for a while and/or when the life responsibilities are piling up, the kind of urgency that turns sex into another chore is a real boner-killer.\n\nNagoski spends most of Come Together on the subject of what emotional and mental states encourage or impede sexual pleasure and openness to sexual pleasure. The underlying advice here is (as I keep saying) useful: identify the emotional states that hit the brakes on sexual feeling, and find ways to move from those states to ones that enable you to hit the accelerator. (Don't blame me, that's Nagoski's metaphor.) I was less enamored of her framing -- the requirement to make a sort of house plan of your psyche in which each state is assigned a room and doorways are located in keeping with which state leads to which others. But what seems like a boring project to me, other people might find enlightening, who knows?\n\nEspecially toward the book's end, but occasionally throughout, Nagoski descends into platitude and woo. I rolled my eyes hard at this, for example:\nIn her book, You Belong, mindfulness teacher Sebene Selassie noticed that “reactive” and “creative” are the same word with the C moved. “What does the C stand for?” a friend asked her. Curiosity, was her answer.\nThis is one step up from \"noticing\" that two people's names are anagrams of each other and deciding that this means they're mortal enemies or whatever. Curiosity is doubtless a good attitude with which to approach self-examination whether or not in a sexual context, but why does that point have to be couched in coincidental nonsense?\n\nThis sort of thing -- of which, as I said, there's more and more as the book progresses -- had me all ready to assign 3 stars. But in getting ready to write this review and looking over my highlights, I remembered how much of value Nagoski offers. So: if the anagrams and emotional house plans work for you, great. But if not, I'd say try not to let any annoyance or impatience with them get in the way of the good stuff, of which there's plenty. \"Judgment is the real thief of joy,\" Nagoski remarks. She's not wrong.\n\nThanks to Ballantine and NetGalley for the ARC.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Not a very helpful \"woke\" approach to figuring out what turns people on sexually. There is a huge lack of solid research or fact-based science; instead, the author tries to please all the modernists that are confused by basic science-based biology and how the majority of people operate.\n\nThere are a couple of good points in it, particularly a very short section on mapping your brain into a \"floor plan\" where you figure out what doors lead to ultimate pleasure. The whole book should have expanded on that; instead, we don't get enough information to figure out our own map and instead get a bunch of lame examples that are amazingly stereotypical for a female author who claims to not want to stereotype.\n\nAnother great (but very small) point is what \"is the key to great sex over the long term...it's not orgasms, sex positions, variety of sexual behaviors or anything else. Honestly? If there's a 'sexual 'behavior\" that predicts sex and relationship satisfaction, it's cuddling.\" Wow.\n\nThe deeper she gets into trying to please the LGBTQ+ community the bigger the mess this becomes. White heterosexual men are slammed to the point of almost being seen as buffoons while women are usually painted as always mistreated by social norms, with of course the exception of lesbians, who the author seems to think have conquered creating sexual connections.\n\nA lot of it is contradictory or makes no sense in context, and the few pieces of research she quotes either don't support her conclusions or are based on people self-reporting their sexual pleasure, which of course is subjective and can't be trusted to draw conclusions.\n\nIt's sad that books based on supposed \"science\" have come to this, where people deny basic biological facts of birth and gender, rejecting objective morality in order to set up individualized random frameworks for self-pleasure while ignoring the concept of coming together to be more interested in helping each other feel good.\nShow more",

I also found it difficult to relate to many of the vignettes throughout the book. They felt flat to me, maybe because they are composites, but they didn’t feel genuine to me.\n\nAs the book went on, I found myself bothered by the negativity. Not the authors tone, but the repeated reminders of all the things that can go wrong, and do go wrong in relationships, and how hard they can be to fix. These were always accompanied by an optimistic solution, but I found myself wishing there were more anecdotes about things that go well in long-term relationships and the joy that having a partner can bring.\n\nRounding down to 3 stars because this was not the book for me right now, but recognizing that there are things to remember and revisit if and when it is.\n\nThanks to NetGalley for the ARC.\nShow more",

There’s going to be a huge aspect of continuity in my care of future patients, and I don’t want to be a doctor that just always pushes meds whenever I could be more understanding of the psychological aspect of whatever sexual or intimate issues they may be facing.\n\nI think this was a wonderful book that gave a lot of great explanation to how to solve a myriad of issues, particularly those of intimacy, within a relationship. Nagoski always does an exceptional job of acknowledging LGBTQIA+ people, which I especially think is an area that does not get enough attention and is often superseded by heterosexual relationships.

        "Review 1": "Buckle up, babes, cause this might be a tad long!\n\nI want to start by saying that overall, I think this is a pretty book with pretty details and an overall good/helpful message that I especially would have benefited from as a teen. Being in my mid-20s and a ~seasoned feminist,~ I didn’t find the topics covered in this book revolutionary and besides really liking the framing of certain concepts and the art, I didn’t quite gain anything new from it. There are some things I really liked, some things I didn’t love, and a couple things I *really* didn’t love… Let’s dive into it!\n\nI’ll start with the positives. In the chapter titled “your rest is your responsibility,” I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of the public bench as a place of pause and using a public bench as an act of resistance in our “go go go” capitalistic world. I genuinely love the idea of the bench as resistance—something we come across so commonly in our day to day that we can turn into a little place of rest and joy if we allow it to is a beautiful thing. I also enjoyed the reference to Jenny Odell’s book, which brings up beautiful rose gardens being turned into bland, mass-produced condos and how sometimes things don’t need to be useful in a quantitative way (monetarily especially) in order to bring value to us. I also like to think of this as needing to be mindful of not replacing the beautiful parts of ourselves with boring, copy-pasted ideals/ways of being that we feel we need to adopt in order to fit in or be accepted or be happy. Later in the book, I think in the chapter about loving yourself, FG wrote something about not spending money when you can’t afford to go out *as an act of self-love.* This framing really clicked for me as an ADHDer with pretty impulsive spending habits. Of course, I *know* that I don’t need that thing I can’t stop thinking about, but *knowing that* doesn’t really help me not spend the money on the thing anyways… But framing NOT spending the money as an act of self-love is incredibly helpful and much more motivating than “well, I don’t NEED it...” which can easily become “well, fuck it, I want it and I deserve it!” I’m definitely going to turn this into some sort of affirmation for myself. I can also say that in the week I spent flipping through the pages of Women Living Deliciously, my awareness of the beautiful things around me has increased a bunch. Centering joy in my life is something I’ve been doing for a few years now but being reminded to do it even more never hurts, and the book itself truly is so stunning. FG’s art is what originally drew me to her on Instagram and I love that she integrates it into her books.\n\nNow, for the things I didn’t like. Honestly, the book was *incredibly repetitive.* I think it could have been half as long and contained just as much information. There were paragraphs with multiple sentences that said the exact same thing, just in different words, or even paragraphs that said the same things as the last paragraph in different words (especially in the excavating section but this was an issue throughout the whole book). I felt like a lot of the topics were approached from a surface level perspective and not delved into very deeply, which is exactly how I felt about Women Don’t Owe You Pretty. While never explicitly stated, I didn’t love the lack of mentioning that while some people thrive by waking up early, it isn’t for everyone! It took me a long time to accept that I simply am not a morning person no matter how hard I’d try to be, and I would have liked to see it pointed out that some people do better with carving out me-time at night. The heavy emphasis on waking up early being (a part of) the solution to one’s problems feels very entrenched in capitalistic ideas of productivity *when it isn’t also acknowledged that there are other options that are just as great for different people.*\n\nNow, I don’t know if this was only an issue in the North American version of the book, but there were many copy editing errors that were annoying to repeatedly encounter. Em dashes were replaced by underscores in almost half the instances in which they appeared. There were two occurrences of a reference to “page xx” and “page xxx” that looked exactly like that, where the page numbers weren’t added in but left as “xx/xxx.” The word “onto” was instead written as “on to” every time it was used. Yes, you might find it rich of me to point this out when there was a literal chapter in the book where FG discussed being accepting of the book being imperfect, but I’m pointing this out not to say “the book should be perfect and isn’t, you’re a terrible person” and more to say that it’s disappointing to spend $35 on a book that has a bunch of easily preventable copy editing errors. This is a publishing issue, not a FG issue. Also, I’m not sure if this was a problem with the North American prints as a whole, a batch of copies, or just my copy of the book, but 16 pages/two chapters were entirely missing! (If you have the US version, make sure you’re not missing pages 114-129, and if you are, contact the publisher for a new copy.)\n\nMoving onto what I REALLY didn’t like… The chapter “the perfect feminist myth” (namely the second half of the chapter) really rubbed me the wrong way. If you follow FG on instagram and ascribe to a version of feminism that extends beyond the self and is built upon an intersectional framework, you’ve likely noticed that despite FG’s entire profitable brand being built on feminism, she never discusses ongoing feminist issues. Many people have expressed upset to her over this and honestly, this chapter felt like a direct response to that, and it felt like an absolute cop-out and a crappy excuse not to use her platform to discuss topics that *aren’t pretty.* Later in the book, in the chapter “I fucking love people,” she goes on a (IMO) passive aggressive rant about people expecting her to speak up on current issues and how they’re just projecting their own guilt onto her… What I actually think is happening here is that FG is trying to assuage her own guilt and failing to recognize that people aren’t projecting their guilt onto her, but expressing their disappointment that she’s profiting off of a version of feminism that doesn’t actually do anything for the people who need feminism the most. “Fucking loving people” and caring about them should extend beyond people privileged enough to buy this book. “Sharing the latest infographic about a crisis,” as she states on page 253 as being a performative act surely *can* be performative, but that just comes down to one’s intentions… She can think it’s being performative if it feels that way to her, but I think many other people, myself included, see it as showing one cares about humans going through terrible shit and has a desire to raise awareness about a given issue. And hey, don’t wanna share an infographic? Okay, then don’t… But maybe share fundraisers and mutual aid funds instead, which have a direct positive impact on people experiencing devastation that an infographic does not if your concern is performativism, instead of throwing your hands up in the air and insisting that anyone who asks you to use your platform to spread awareness is trying to take away your agency. To be clear, I’m not saying that feminism that discusses women focusing on joy and gratitude isn’t also essential, but that this type of feminism isn’t actually feminist if that’s all it consists of.\n\nI think this book is great for people who don’t know how to put themselves first, who are constantly feeling like they’re not good enough, who don’t know how to identify the beauty around them, who rarely feel joy, and I’d say it’d be especially transformative for younger people/teenagers. If you’re someone who feels in control of your life and centres joy and gratitude in it already, I don’t think you’ll get very much beyond an unarguably gorgeous addition to your bookshelf.\nShow more",

        "Review 3": "Vor kurzem kam Überraschungspost vom KiWi-Verlag bei mir an: Women Living Deliciously von Florence Given. Ein feministisches Buch mit einem quietschbunten Cover, das wie in einem psychedelischen Hippietraum wirkt. Ein Buch, zu dem ich höchstwahrscheinlich im Laden nie gegriffen hätte. Reingelesen habe ich natürlich trotzdem. Stilistisch war es jetzt nicht unbedingt meins und ich bin auch der Meinung, dass ich nicht unbedingt die richtige Zielgruppe bin. Das klingt jetzt alles erstmal eher negativ. Doch nun kommt das große ABER: inhaltlich fand ich das Buch nämlich wirklich gut. Und ich habe mir tatsächlich etliche Stellen markiert, etwas, das ich sonst fast nie mache.\nFlorence Given zeigt auf, worin der Zusammenhang zwischen den Gedanken, den sich Frauen über ihren Körper und ihr Äußeres machen, und dem Patriarchat besteht: würden Frauen sich weniger den Kopf darüber zerbrechen, hätten sie viel mehr Energie, sich um anderes zu kümmern, könnten stärker mit Männern konkurrieren, was letztere zu unterdrücken versuchen. Sie berichtet von der Falle der Hyperunabhängigkeit, in die Frauen gerne tappen, und von weiteren Problemen.\nIm Anschluss gibt sie Tipps dazu, wie Frauen sich lebendiger fühlen können, mehr nach ihren eigenen Regeln und Bedürfnissen leben können.\nEinige dieser Dinge ergeben sich (zumindest bei mir) über die Zeit, weswegen ich mich nicht als hauptsächliche Zielgruppe sehe. Vieles davon hätte ich jedoch gerne früher gewusst bzw. verstanden, weshalb ich das Buch vor allem jüngeren Leserinnen empfehlen würde. Ich bin mir sicher, dass diese sehr viel aus ihm herausholen werden. Doch auch in meinem Alter (das klingt jetzt, als wäre ich uralt 😅), lassen sich noch viele neue Erkenntnisse aus dem Text ziehen.\nIch wünsche dem Buch sehr viele Leser*innen. Und auch wenn nicht jede von ihnen gleich eine radikale Veränderung durchmachen wird/muss, so werden sie definitiv ein paar Kleinigkeiten daraus mitnehmen, die das Leben erleichtern.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Yes, I 100% fell for the marketing strategies of this book - primarily the beautiful cover design.\n\nFirstly, I want to point out that this book is not necessarily bad, it’s just probably not for me. Not all art is created for everyone but I do have a few thoughts.\n\nI’ve followed Florence on Instagram for a while. She seems joyful and I think her pink hair and outfits are cool. I also agree with her mentality about making your space beautiful and visually pleasing, taking notice of things etc.\n\nDo I think this book was well intentioned? Mostly likely, yes. Do I think this book was partly a money grab? Well, also yes.\n\nAs I was reading, the whole thing just felt a bit…empty. I remember when Women Don’t Owe You Pretty came out in 2020 (and there was some controversy about potentially imitating another author’s work). At the time, it was lauded as something groundbreaking and I, once again, fell for the 70s font of the book and general ‘vibe’.\n\nI suppose a part of me was curious to see how Florence’s writing has evolved since then. It seems harsh to say this but…it hasn’t evolved at all really, which is a shame.\n\nThe book is quite trite and overly idiosyncratic for my personal taste. I’m aware that this book could really be of benefit to some people and help them feel empowered, but I just don’t feel I really got anything from it.\n\nThe book seems to me an example of excessively telling over showing. The same examples are repeated and some are questionable, like walking through Soho at night with headphones on to make the experience…cinematic…???\n\nThere is something radical about seeking joy in a volatile and sometimes hostile world—is it a distinctly feminist issue, I’m not sure. But at least at this time in my life, I’m seeking more depth.\nShow more",

        "Review 6": "I’ve loved Florence Given for years — she has this joyful tenacity and confidence that is so contagious. I’ve been looking forward to this book since she announced it, and it did not disappoint!! This book puts together everything she expressed online in her videos into one source — covering body confidence, finding joy, setting boundaries, saying no, loving yourself, and more.\n\n“Loving ourselves isn't a goal, but an intention, a direction, a slow and sustainable lifelong commitment. It needs to be a process and not an accomplishment.”\n\nWomen Living Deliciously feels like a culmination of everything you could ever need to live your most vibrant life. It takes all the key elements of other self-help books and applies it to womanhood, and puts it into actionable steps to help create change. There are things I’ve been stuck on for years that finally made sense with the way Florence explained it. Moreover though, I felt inspired to actually make change, because it felt like a friend telling you what you needed to hear. It’s compassionate, expressive, and passionate. This is a book I believe every woman should read, especially women in their 20s and 30s. I can’t wait to get a physical copy when it releases to keep on my shelf and read over and over again. Florence really makes you want to live a delicious life.\n\n“Audacity is contagious and I hope some of mine rubs off on you.” — Florence Given, Women Living Deliciously\n\nThanks to NetGalley, Simon & Schuster and Simon Element, and Florence Given for the eArc!\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "I am manifesting you clicking 'like' on this review.\n\nMind Magic is a self-help book. It looks at positive thinking/affirmations/visualization/law of attraction/et al, heretofore manifestation, and looks at it from a scientific angle, specifically neuroscience and psychology.\n\nThe hook here is how the author calls out the proponents of it as bullshit artists, or at least as morally unglued, as the opening scene has him having manifest a life that he hates.\n\nThe author presents a good theory as to why manifestation works, which amounts to the factory settings of your brain not necessarily being those that serve the intentional part of your mind. Manifestation works to set your preconscious act in concert with your conscious towards accomplishing things.\n\nThe premise is a mild bait and switch. The lessons here are about meditation and mindfulness. That is the core skill around which all the other work is built. But it makes sense in the context of the author’s theory. You need to practice awareness in hearing the erroneous messages to find out how to turn down their volume. And if you can get what you want, are you sure that you know what you want?\n\nThe author is a gifted writer. I am envious of his turn of phrase, and how he can write a sentence that sums something up while also presenting a novel way of thinking about it. I was going to make a further joke about envying the author’s worldly success, and snarking about crying into his Châteauneuf-du-Pape over the Gatsby act the book opens with, but this is one of those cases where I will give it a pass. Yes, the stories tend towards people of enormous achievement, where I am left feeling like these people at their reported worst do better than me at my seeming best. But all reinforce the author’s theme around the importance of values and service, even when they get immodestly wealthy in the course of things.\n\nThe book is aware of the structural limitations to this sort of thing, both social and biological, and takes a additive approach. You can’t stop racism or ADHD, but you can build around them. The book makes a point around focusing on the goals and not the methods, and being open to things that might change in the process. And the book scores big on being oriented towards its functional use, both in the process-loaded meditations but also affirming the validity of ‘skipping to the end’ and only reading the how-to as opposed to why. I find it interesting that in a book where I think that the author is particularly skilled in writing, but he is less precious about it than writers of similar books, who insist that you need to understand it all to understand one part.\n\nMy first problem is that it is more sciencey than scientific. This is not a study of manifestation, but taking modern science and creating a framework for how manifestation might fit in it. Since it is psychology and neuroscience, it is more credible than if a physicist did it, and there are studies that are adjacent to it that back up things, but it lacks the sort of trenchancy that I want.\n\nMy second problem gets a little bloggy, but it feels like there is some unspoken information here. The author tells the story of the problems of building a habit of exercise, specifically after getting older and fatter and having an injury that made progress difficult. At this point my eyes perk up, and I suspect that this is something that a lot of us are nodding along with, myself included. And so I am expecting to read about how the author puts some of the ideas that he has here into practice, and interested to see how I can appropriate them.\n\nInstead, this is the suck it up buttercup section of the book. I understand this in the macro, that sort of Do the Work, you cannot manifest your way into being an actor if you do not audition. In the micro, I am reminded of the Art of Gathering: if I could do the thing, I would not be reading a book about the thing. Or I guess that I am reading the wrong book?\n\nRephrased, there are points in the book where the order of operations flips. It switches from here is the way to think about doing the hard thing and becomes here is the hard thing that gets you to think the right way. I do not think that the author is incorrect in this sentiment, (or I am wiling to act on it as if), but I feel like there must be some categorization function that I do not see. Or maybe the error is going into a generalist book with specific questions.\n\nThis is a self-help book, and so the value and utility of it is what you get out of it, which is related to what you put in. (Brief aside to Hoff and Castañeda aside) there is nothing harmful here, where there could be a lot based on the scope of the content. I hope it helps you, but I also think that there a question of who it can help.\nShow more",

        "Review 8": "Gotta say I really loved the cover design for this one. I'm always skeptical of shit like this BUT WE'RE GIVING ANOTHER BOOK ANOTHER GO. Should've just focused on visualisation since that's the science side but at least it's the best one I've read so far.\n\nWhat was good (ish) in this book:\n- To produce the results we desire, we must first believe in our ability to produce those results. This is where metacognition – the awareness and understanding of our own thought processes – comes into play. Metacognition allows us to recognise and overcome the limiting beliefs and patterns that hold us back, paving the way for personal growth and transformation.\n- Find a comfortable position, relax, and breathe deeply. Visualize yourself displaying the behavior you would like to manifest – see in great detail how you would perform this behavior. After five minutes of visualization, write your goal down on paper. Close your eyes and embed this intention by visualizing yourself carrying it out. In the morning, read your written goal to reinforce the intention for the day. Whenever you actualize this intention, record a sentence congratulating yourself for meeting your intention.\n- In today's manifestation culture, there is often a misguided focus on material wealth, cars, houses, and status symbols. (at least someone said it)\n- The brain filters information through a process known as value tagging, in which it assigns emotional value to various stimuli, experiences, and memories. When we tap into and are mindful of positive experiences, we can “remind” ourselves of how real and attainable those positive feelings will be when we accomplish our intention.\n- not sure about this ancedote: When Jim Carrey was a struggling actor living in a run-down Toronto apartment, he did something audacious – he wrote himself a cheque for $10 million for “Acting Services Rendered,” dated it for Thanksgiving 1995, and carried it in his wallet. This bold act of manifesting his dreams into reality may seem foolish, but just a few years later, Carrey was one of the biggest comedy stars on the planet. His story illustrates the power of embedding intentions deeply into the unconscious mind.\n- This is where visualization comes in. By repeatedly imagining our desired outcome in vivid detail, we train our brains to recognize and become comfortable with that future reality. This “cognitive ease” signals the mind to start devoting mental resources to making that vision a tangible success. (so why not just call it visualisation since that's the science side of it?)\n- Try this exercise: Find a quiet, private space and relax through deep breathing. Visualize your current intention, then zoom out. What’s the broader context surrounding this goal? Who else is affected, and how might achieving it create positive ripples? Will it inspire others, bring joy to your community, or solve problems?\n- Clinging too tightly to a particular envisioned outcome blinds us to other emerging opportunities and causes us to lose presence in the current moment. We may overlook wonderful developments unfolding simply because they don’t match our predetermined ideals.\n\nThought dumps:\n- This practice generates dispositional optimism, a trait that has been linked to numerous benefits, including better physical and mental health, increased resilience, and a greater likelihood of achieving goals. It is rooted in ancient spiritual traditions like the Vedic scriptures and New England Transcendentalists’ “Law of Attraction.” Today, our understanding of neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to reorganize neural pathways – provides scientific insights into manifestation’s mechanisms, showing that this ancient spiritual practice is rooted in science. (sure, i guess)\n- In the world we operate in today, our focus is under constant threat. Smartphones, for instance, are designed to pull at our attention, with the average American spending a staggering 1,460 hours per year on these devices – equivalent to 91 waking days. (I never see a good example when it comes to Americans but this is both funny and just embarrassing)\n- Self-efficacy is a potent force, often serving as a self-fulfilling prophecy. (oh how I would love a psych person to break down why this isn't good haha)\n- there are six steps to the manifestation process: one, focus and build self-efficacy; two, clarify your true desires; three, silence the inner critic through self-compassion; four, embed your intention through vivid visualization; five, chase your intention with passionate commitment; and six, open yourself to how the universe may guide your intention. (sure)\nShow more",

        "Review 10": "James R. Doty’s \"Mind Magic: The Neuroscience of Manifestation and How It Changes Everything\" explores how the practice of manifestation can lead to personal and professional success by harnessing the power of the mind. Manifestation involves setting an intention so vividly that it becomes ingrained in the unconscious, triggering brain networks geared towards achieving that goal. This process fosters a strong belief in one’s capabilities, which is linked to better health, increased resilience, and a higher likelihood of attaining goals. Drawing from ancient spiritual traditions and modern neuroplasticity research, Doty explains that manifestation is scientifically grounded. By focusing thoughts and emotions on desired outcomes, one strengthens neural pathways, creating a cycle where aligned actions reinforce the manifestation process. Manifestation is not a cure-all but a tool that promotes resilience, positive mindsets, and the alignment of actions with aspirations.\n\nThe first step in effective manifestation is focus. Focus is the ability to channel attention towards inner intentions, transcending distractions and obstacles. In today’s world, attention is constantly under threat from devices like smartphones, which can lead to feelings of helplessness and fatigue. However, this sense of helplessness is an illusion. Everyone has agency—the power to shape their circumstances. Self-efficacy, the belief in one’s ability to achieve goals, is crucial and acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy. High self-efficacy motivates individuals to aim higher and work harder. Metacognition, the awareness of one’s thought processes, helps overcome limiting beliefs and patterns, enabling personal growth. To build focus and self-efficacy, Doty recommends a visualization exercise where one imagines themselves displaying desired behaviors, writes down the goal, and reinforces the intention daily.\n\nThe second step is to clarify one’s true desires. Often, people focus on material wealth and status symbols, which can distort the true power of manifestation. Instead, it is important to identify what truly brings fulfillment and joy, such as meaningful relationships, passion projects, and connection with nature. Positive emotions act as catalysts for manifestation by activating the brain’s reward system, which directs attention to experiences that caused those emotions. This process, known as value tagging, assigns emotional value to stimuli and memories, helping to recreate positive experiences. To gain clarity, Doty suggests visualizing success, engaging in a body scan relaxation technique, and then vividly imagining the details of success. Writing down this vision further reinforces the intention.\n\nThe third step involves silencing the inner critic. This negative internal voice, stemming from the sympathetic nervous system’s fight or flight response, can erode self-belief and discourage risk-taking. To overcome this, one must soothe the primitive nervous system through self-compassionate practices. By relaxing the body and mind, one reassures the brain, allowing negative voices to quiet. Doty recommends dedicating time to be alone, relaxing through deep breathing, recalling positive memories, and transforming negative self-beliefs into positive affirmations. Regular practice can rewire mental patterns, fostering optimism and resilience.\n\nThe fourth step is to embed one’s intention deeply into the subconscious mind. Doty recounts how Jim Carrey, as a struggling actor, wrote himself a $10 million cheque, which eventually became a reality. This illustrates the power of sustained reinforcement of intentions. The brain tends to absorb only essential information, so repeated visualization in vivid detail helps the mind recognize and become comfortable with the desired outcome. This cognitive ease signals the brain to allocate resources toward achieving that vision. Doty suggests meditating on a specific goal, visualizing it richly, and writing down the experience to embed the intention.\n\nThe fifth step is to chase the intention passionately. Manifestation requires practice and commitment. Starting with small goals and savoring incremental successes helps build confidence. Paying attention to clues from the unconscious mind, such as recurring phrases or synchronicities, can guide one’s efforts. Aligning intentions with a deeper sense of purpose enhances the manifestation process. Doty advises visualizing the broader context of a goal, considering its impact on others, and writing a purpose statement to reinforce the intention.\n\nThe final step is to open oneself to how the universe may guide the intention. Letting go of rigid expectations about how an intention will materialize allows one to remain open to synchronicities and emerging opportunities. By observing the impacts of actions, one can recalibrate their inner compass. Clinging too tightly to specific outcomes can cause missed opportunities and hinder presence in the moment. Doty recommends practicing body relaxation, reflecting on past goals, and fostering self-compassion to loosen attachment to specific results.\n\nThe overarching message of \"Mind Magic\" is that manifestation involves six key steps: focusing to build self-efficacy, clarifying true desires, silencing the inner critic, embedding intentions through visualization, passionately pursuing goals, and opening oneself to the universe’s guidance. By following these steps, individuals can harness the power of their minds to achieve their deepest aspirations and transform their lives.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Essentials for an advanced reader copy. The opinions expressed are mine alone.\n\nWhen I started reading “Unstressable” I really didn’t like it. I kept going and am glad I did. It’s still not one I am sure I’ll recommend but there were at least some interesting nuggets of information throughout the last 2/3 of the book. The reason for the low rating is because I felt like there were way too many run-on sentences. This made it hard to follow what the author was trying to say. I also felt like there were too many mnemonic devices the authors made up. While each on their own could have been helpful, I got lost trying to remember what they all meant. I also felt there was a lot of “do this, not that” advice that wasn't practical and/or sensitive to individuals with chronic health conditions. These are often the people who need reign in stress the most and sometimes it felt like the authors minimized the fact we can’t always control how our body responds to stress. They did point out a few times the importance of seeking professional help in cases of trauma or PTSD so that was good at least. Finally, I found it confusing when the authors kept using “I” because I never knew which author was “speaking”.\n\nAll in all, while I think the authors had the best intentions in writing this book I am not sure I’ll be recommending it. The writing style felt like one extremely long blog post… I think that a significant portion of the book could have been trimmed out without taking away from the main points and would have made it a more engaging read.",
        "Review 2": "Special thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for a free, electronic ARC of this novel received in exchange for an honest review.\n\nExpected publication date: April 30, 2024\n\nMo Gawdat is an engineer, who used to be the Chief Business Officer at Google. Big deal, right? Well, when Mo’s son died unexpectedly after a routine surgery, he began to question the choices he was making in his life. Pairing up with co-author Alice Law, he wrote “Unstressable: A Practical Guide to Stress-Free Living”, in order to reach a greater community and provide them with the tips needed to enjoy (and live) a stress-free life.\n\nSounds to good to be true, right? I have read many self-help and non-fiction books that focus on how to destress, reduce anxiety and live a calmer life. My diagnosed anxiety and Type A personality make the most “common” tension reducing methods null and void, as my brain will continue to race like a hamster in a wheel. But I keep trying, and when I got the chance to read “Unstressable” my only thought was- what do I have to lose?\n\nMo and Alice have both suffered the tragic loss of their fathers (and his son, for Mo, and sister, for Alice) from causes related to stress, and this was the turning point for both of them. “Unstressable” has a little bit of everything, for everyone, from the neuroscience and physics component of the brain and the human body right through to Reiki and the calming of the soul. Not every part will be relevant to everyone, but everyone will find something relevant within these pages.\n\nThe book is easy to read and generalizable, to people of all ages, stages and professions. For those of us who have tried therapy, there are a few tried and true tips that we will be familiar with, but Law and Gawdat provide some intriguing ideas as well, that seem worth trying.\n\nI enjoyed the neuroscience aspect of the novel (less so the physics and the math) and although I am not a huge proponent of Eastern medicine, I was still able to find some useful strategies. The authors personify the brain, which was intriguing, using inner dialogue as a way to bring attention to areas of the body that we are lacking. For anyone who finds value in meditation and mindfulness, well, the authors have you covered there, too.\n\nIf nothing else, this book provides a unique way to look at stress itself and how it can show up in the body (and mind). It helped me reframe how I look at my inner conversations and self-awareness, and it even provided me with a few tips to try. I don’t see a complete cure to my medically-diagnosed anxiety (but the authors don’t claim to solve this, in their defense) but this book was definitely worth reading!",

My only complaint is that it is a rather long book, and for people who are easily stressed, it feels a bit stressful to have to read more than 300 pages to help solve your stress.\n\nI received a copy of this book from Netgalley. All thoughts and opinions are entirely my own, and I am writing a voluntary review.",

As with all this type of book, the key points could be make in half the time however that does not mean it's not worth a read. It contains inspiring and practical advice on how to live stress free. That can be boiled down to healthy habits, mindfulness, and recognising that you have a choice about how you react to anything that happens. That's simplifying it significantly so do give it a go if you think you might benefit.\n\n4/5\n\nUnstressable is a handbook for those who realize stress isn’t what happens to you; it’s how you handle what happens to you. It’s a left brainer’s solution to a modern right-brain problem. Mo Gawdat is an engineer. What most of us see as inchoate, insurmountable problems he sees as systems overloads to tackle and solve. Unstressable breaks stress into inputs and effects, classifying human stressors stress to the mind, stress to emotions, stress to the body, and stress to the soul. Once classified, Gawdat and co-author Alice Law show readers how stress can be predicted—with mathematical certainty—and once predicted, prevented. Unstressable shows readers how most of us deal with the unpleasant, anxiety-producing and even miserable or tragic events in our stress is always a by-product, leading directly to inability to cope, health problems and cratered confidence. Gawdat guides readers to no-woo-woo, all-science-based solutions. He’ll train readers —Develop habits and attitudes of listening and learning that limit stress —Learn the language of de-stressing mind, emotions, body and soul —Respond, not react —Release self-criticism, insomnia, and lethargy —Increase energy, focus and confidence\n\n\n",

        "Review 1": "For most of my year, I experience only fleeting moments of feeling lonely. That always changes around the Christmas holiday, though, even though my daughter and my best friend come to visit. A clearer understanding of this came when I received a Christmas card that featured the message across the front, \"Christmas Is For Families.\" Having been divorced for years, and losing a beloved dog this past November who had been with me for over 14-years, I realized that most messages I receive during this time are subtlety slanted toward Being Together With Family. Singles aren't specifically prohibited, but there is a faint suggestion of being an intruder.\n\nI suppose that is why I felt drawn toward SINGLE AT HEART: THE POWER, FREEDOM, AND HEART-FILLING JOY OF SINGLE LIFE at the close of this year. The writer is not advocating that people adopt the single life (although the benefits are liberally addressed ... occasionally with multiple repetitions). No, the core of the book is about being true to one's \"Authentic Self,\" and the difficulties (real and imagined) that may be encountered in doing so.\n\nFrankly, before reading this, I've never stopped to deeply consider if I gravitated toward being Single At Heart in lieu of \"Coupledom.\" This was in large part due to having a pet companion who brought me daily joy. As I've looked back on my \"preferences,\" though, I've become aware that many of them grew out of stories and beliefs that have been shared with me since childhood. For instance, when recognizing that I would be living in my house alone for the foreseeable future, my first thought was that I needed to move to someplace much smaller because ... well, why should a solo person inhabit this much space? One person doesn't \"need\" that. While reading the book, my thinking changed to, \"If you can afford it and you love it, why not?\" (I have even referred to my house to others as \"The Retreat.\")\n\nSINGLE AT HEART questions the obligations of living up to the expectations of others. It asks us to \"Flip the Question\" that we may be asking ourselves or are asked by others, and to ponder a different perspective. That is a very valuable Gift.\n\nYesterday, the local newspaper had a cartoon that seemed most appropriate to this consideration. It showed a number of people at a New Year's Eve party gathered around a television screen to \"watch the Ball drop.\" The \"thinking\" caption, apparently coming from one fellow who was wearing a party hat and holding a drink at the back of the avidly-enthralled group, was \"Only 5 more seconds until I can go home ... Only 4 more seconds until I can go home.\" I smiled, especially because I knew I would be home in bed and asleep ... until the neighborhood firecrackers wake me up for a few minutes.\n\nI would strongly recommend SINGLE AT HEART: THE POWER, FREEDOM, AND HEART-FILLING JOY OF THE SINGLE LIFE to anyone who has difficulties with self-reflection. The book doesn't ask the Reader to buy-into any set response (other than being more aware and tolerant of those who are different from ourselves). At the very least, it provides a baseline for the self-reflection for various themes and points, allowing either personal identification or rejection of them. It also provides awareness of policies, practices and attitudes at many levels that range from mildly unfair to causing significant emotional injury.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "I feel really crabby after reading this book. I found it to be super repetitive and lacking in depth and nuance. I have always felt \"single at heart\" and have often taken pride in my single identity and the different variations of it throughout my life. That said, this book perpetuates a lot of problematic narratives and fails to integrate any discussion of power whatsoever. The entire book is based on a middle or upper class experience with no acknowledgement of it, and perpetuates an individualistic, hyper-independent approach to life. While certainly some bucking of the master narrative around coupledom is important, the notion that it is healthy to completely go it our own is such a westernized, dominant culture narrative. The discussions of race are highly superficial, bordering on tokenizing. The intersection between single identity and asexuality or aromantic identities is significant and this book includes about 2 paragraphs on each. The book also promotes a zero-sum mentality, constantly comparing \"single\" experiences with coupledom, setting them up as in competition with each other, frequently noting how \"single\" life is \"better\" than being in a couple. While that might be true for some, including me, the last thing our culture needs is another \"culture war\" around something as instrumental to our lives as this. Im so over the zero-sum, individualistic, un-nuanced approach to everything in our culture. Disappointed is obviously an understatement about how I feel about this book. I actually think it has the potential to cause harm with it's lack of nuance and broad, blanket generalizations about people. The author has not done her own work to interrogate systems of power beyond her own experiences with sexism and single-ism.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Bella DePaulo is a social psychologist and academic whose focus of study in recent years has been people who are \"single at heart,\" as she writes about in this book. The focus of this work is largely distinct from nonfiction I've previously read on solitude (memoirs like Howard Axelrod's The Point of Vanishing: A Memoir of Two Years in Solitude), or books about living alone (like Eric Klinenberg's Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone, or sociological examinations of women specifically delaying marrige (like Rebecca Traister's All the Single Ladies). Instead, Dr. DePaulo's focus is people with a variety of sexual and romantic orientations (including heterosexual, LGBTQ+, asexual, demisexual, and aromantic) who feel happiest and most fulfilled outside of marriage or long-term monogamous romantic relationships.\n\nDr. DePaulo has developed a survey to assess whether people are \"single at heart\" available on her website; these include (somewhat leading) questions like:\n\n\nHow do you feel about searching for a long-term romantic partner?\n\na. Maybe it feels like something you \"should\" do, but you are not really all that interested.\n\nb. The process may or may not be exciting and fun, but a successful outcome would be great.\n\n\nand\n\n\nMany couples expect to be each other's \"plus-one\" for just about every occasion. How do you feel about that?\n\na. You prefer to sometimes attend events on your own, sometimes with other people, and sometimes just to stay home.\n\nb. You take comfort in having a person in your life who is obligated to be your plus-one, even though you'll be obligated to be your partner's plus-one at events that you might prefer to skip.\n\n\nShe draws heavily in this book from responses and extended interviews from people who've self-selected to be in her data set (the scientist in me has to stress the nature of self-selection here! this is not a representative population survey, just like online product or business reviews are rarely a representative survey of all customers but rather tend to attract people with strong positive or negative feelings). She also pulls data from other sources, but probably >50% of the book is a result of her own survey's data, with many of the same individuals being quoted over and over. The book is also quite repetitive and wordy, and could have likely been condensed by around 50% without losing any significant content.\n\nThat being said, I do see value in books like this for people curious about this topic or seeking affirmation that their lifestyle preferences and choices don't make them weird or bad. I think there definitely is a social stigma against people (particularly women) who don't aspire to marry or have kids (even present in books ostensibly celebrating these lifestyles, like in Peggy O'Donnell Heffington's Without Children: The Long History of Not Being a Mother), and some people still feel pressured to conform. I think those people will find Single at Heart reassuring and empowering.\n\nMy statistics:\nBook 258 for 2024\nBook 1861 cumulatively\n\n\n\n\nShow more",

        "Review 5": "The joy radiates from this book. I got hooked on DePaulo's work with Singled Out (2004), and there's a lot of personal and professional growth shown here, from years of experience with new research and the online group, Community of Single People. With irreverent humor, DePaulo pokes holes in the prevailing myths and stereotypes to reveal a subset of single people, those who choose it and like it that way.\nShow more",

        "Review 9": "The book had good concepts that relate to me as a single guy: freedom and solitude.\n\nI wish there was more discussion on the stigma single people face.",
        "Review 10": "I feel like the definition of \"Single at Heart\" is still too ill defined for me to truly grasp the concept. The idea seems to be both too inclusive by stating that anyone can identify as single as heart, even those in active romantic relationships, but yet it's too exclusionary by regularly stating specific characteristics that define someone that is single at heart and not matching those characteristics indicate that the subject is simply just unafraid of being single or actually aspires for a romantic relationship. It also very barely touches on asexuality and aromantic, keeping the concepts contained to only chapter 7, which is surprising given how these sexualities can likely be incredibly intertwined with this concept of \"single at heart\" if the author chose to do deeper research on them.\n\nThe true benefit to this book is that it serves as a direct challenge to compulsory coupling and the idea that being in a relationship gives you an automatic advantage in life. It's a great exploration of the advantages of remaining single and prioritizing solitude over the expected partnership demanded in our society to prove that you're a \"real\" adult. I especially enjoyed the chapter studying the difference in happiness levels between single adults and married adults and how single adults are regularly happier than married folks, but society perceives them as less so due to their lack of relationship status.\n\nAlso the writing style is a bit woo-woo and quote heavy for my tastes, but at least it made it a quicker than expected read.\nShow more"

        "Review 3": "I have read the first bits available on Amazon to get a feel for this book. I will be buying it to read once the mountain of other books I have purchased is down to a low hill. I just wanted to say, when I read books like this, that give the scientific basis of long-lasting and beneficial relationships, I often wonder if the writer has considered pathological types who maintained great relationships, to the horror of the world. I am thinking of creeps like Mao, Hitler, Stalin, to name the worst killers in human history, who remained in power until their deaths, surrounded by adoring supporters most of us can only dream of. It seems to me that these dreadful human beings knew very well all the lessons that Robson is discussing. My thought is this: perhaps, sometimes, it would be better for human history, and the lives of millions, if some creeps just stayed under their rock, lonely, miserable and incapable of making friends. I really would love to read a chapter in a book like this that stressed that if you are a killer inside, that, really, you should stop reading this book and live a life bereft of human support.

        "Review 9": "The author makes a big deal at the beginning that this is not just another book describing crappy irrelevant psych studies. No sir, he is going to give you the super solid science. YAY! But then he doesn't deliver. Social isolation and loneliness can be bad for you. Sure. But don't exaggerate the problem by saying it's as bad as smoking, for example.\nA lot of the rest is based on typical psych studies that have little to do with the real world, or on pop psychology like \"Mindset\" that as far as I know has not been shown in rigorous trials to be helpful.\nSomething I found weird throughout is that the subject is a social problem, but it's treated mainly as an individual problem of the isolated/lonely person. Maybe population-level factors matter for strengthening or weakening social networks?\n\nAlternatives:\nThe Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Affects Our Health and Longevity\nThe Broken Ladder: How Inequality Affects the Way We Think, Live, and Die\nLost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\nNerd addendum:\nHe starts out discussing the extraordinary claim about how loneliness is the new smoking. One of the studies he cites for this is a meta-analysis that got a lot of media attention. (https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicin...). I understand if you're a reporter on a deadline just copying what the press release says. But he's writing a whole book on the topic and this is the foundational idea, because without this big bad problem, who cares?\nSo what should he have clarified about this study?\n1) Meta-analysis, schmeta-analysis. Just because you slam a bunch of studies together to get a big sample size doesn't mean you have stronger results. If you pile together a lot of turds, what you get is a huge pile of crap. If you're going to tout this paper, you need to verify that the original studies included were all robust.\n2) In good epidemiological research, one of the most basic things is to control for potential confounders. Only some of the studies in the meta-analysis controlled for confounders. In order to smush these together with the ones that did not control, the authors took only unadjusted results from all the studies. This is likely to artificially inflate the effect of isolation/loneliness.\n3) Smoking is NOT a variable they controlled for. That is what you might think when you hear that someone did a study and showed that \"X was as bad as smoking.\"\n4) What they did do was to use historical data on how bad smoking is as a comparison. Whatever. But the definition they used for smoking was NOT smoking at least a pack a day as one would expect. They used \"<15 cigarettes daily.\" So, 0-14 cigarettes. So, not smoking???? How does this make any sense???? I don't know. It's not for me to explain. It's the onus of the guy building a book on this study to explain its validity.\n5) The context to include here is that the increased risk of lung cancer from smoking is like 19 times! (And all-cause mortality is doubled.)\n6) I think this paper (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37337...) is a better review of the relevant research on the topic. It includes mostly studies that controlled for other causes of death. The effect is there (32% increased risk for social isolation, 14% for loneliness) but it's not as scary as suggested in the book. It's not good to turn everything into a crisis, or to underplay huge public health issues like smoking.\n7) Again, maybe I'm wrong about all this, based on a little bit of looking stuff up. But it smells fishy to me.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "Once finished with this book, you are provided with several 'takeaways': a list of 13 so called 'Laws of Connection' which become softened in their defining as social strategies, 'that will transform your life' apparently. There are also a number of links to websites referred to along the way, such as the REACH Forgiveness Programme, a self-compassion resources hub, and those now notorious set of questions promoted as everything from conversation prompters to a recipe for falling in love - 32 of them I believe.\n\nSpeaking of recipes, this book tends toward the sociological 'recipe' sort. Each chapter follows a discernible format, stringing together one study after another, dipping into research papers and projects alike using phrases such as 'participants tended to..., the results revealed..., 6 out of 10 respondents claimed..., and so on. Not a lot of critical evaluation though, just the presentation of clusters of raw data with all the involved scientific bits removed for the benefits of your average punter who, after all, just wants to know why that apparent friend never returns their phone calls.\n\nIn other words, making and maintaining friendships, relationships, connections is not an exact science. And no amount of studies, questionnaires, and thought experiments are going to produce anything resembling a formulae that is foolproof and ultimately life transforming.\n\nIt occurred to me while reading this, and it was enjoyable I should say, while working on all these social strategies - being consistent with how I treat others, check my assumptions, be generous with praise and open about my vulnerabilities, ask for help and be civil etc. - what were all the other self-centred narcissists doing to meet me half way?\n\nIs it any wonder I steer clear of social media platforms and will continue to do so. Thanks for the reminder David, a connection is formed between two people, not someone doing all the heavy lifting on their own.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "It’s taken a few years for me to confront and peel back the negative ideas of mental health help I’ve carried over the years and the reasons why I spent a lot of time avoiding picking up books directly related to mental health. When I experienced my very first panic attack years ago, I just wanted all the emotions to go away. I was convinced they were wrong and I wasn’t normal and if the panic, anxiety, panic, depression could go away, I could go back to my “normal” self. I carried a lot of shame for a while about how I was feeling until I literally couldn’t suppress how I was feeling anymore. It was then that I tried to explain to my Mamá how I was feeling and she opened up with stories about our family’s history with mental health that I had never heard before. The thing that stood out to me was that our conversation didn’t happen with the terms/language used in a therapist’s office. Instead, experiences were described which I could later understand thanks to seeking out help from a mental health professional.\n\nThis book mirrored that for me. Dr. Buqué masterfully weaves her personal stories with that of her clients illustrating the impact of intergenerational trauma not just on our mental health but within our bodies. I found this not just that but also a guide and resource for sitting with trauma and holistically addressing healing. I listened to it first via audio which is typically how I most feel capable of approaching books that center on mental health. I find that listening and doing something with my hands helps me stay focused & not spiral out into trying to diagnose myself. I would highly recommend the audiobook if that happens to you as well. I would also recommend a physical copy to have on hand to go back and do the exercises outlined. Some of them even ended up being great writing prompts for me too.\n\nOverall, these past few years I’ve felt a lot less shame about my mental health and have read a lot more books on the topic. This one lands high on my “Books that help me understand my brain better” list. Coming in with it would also be \"The Deepest Well: Healing the Long-Term Effects of Childhood Adversity\" by Nadine Burke Harris and \"But What Will People Say? Navigating Mental Health, Identity. Love and Family Between Cultures\" by Sahaj Kaur Kohli.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Dr. Mariel Buqué's \"Break The Cycle\" is a paradigm-shifting guide that not only excavates the roots of intergenerational trauma but also offers a revolutionary approach to healing it. As an Afro-Dominican psychologist, Dr. Buqué draws upon her extensive expertise and personal experiences to deliver a groundbreaking narrative that marries scientific insight with practical exercises and profound stories from her therapy room.\n\nThe book eloquently introduces readers to the concept of intergenerational trauma, depicting how unresolved emotional wounds traverse across generations, impacting individuals, families, and entire communities. Dr. Buqué powerfully illustrates this concept by sharing her childhood experience, at the age of ten years old, of trekking miles to fetch water with her grandmother in the Dominican Republic, a poignant metaphor for what our foremother's endured in order to meet their own basic needs and that of our families.\n\nWhat makes \"Break The Cycle\" a compelling read is Dr. Buqué's remarkable ability to blend ancient and indigenous healing practices with modern therapeutic methodologies. Her unique, holistic approach is underlined throughout the book, reflecting her dedication to integrating sound bath meditation, breathwork, and other holistic practices into therapy, propelling a new era in trauma healing.\n\nAs a reader, I found myself deeply touched by Dr. Buqué's courage in sharing her personal journey as a Dominican immigrant and how she navigated through inherited intergenerational trauma. Her adept storytelling interlaces her own experiences with those of her clients, offering diverse yet relatable stories that vividly elucidate the transformative power of healing and doing so by honoring our ancestral healing practices.\n\nDr. Buqué challenges the status quo in Western psychology by highlighting the deficiency in addressing intergenerational trauma, a sentiment I wholeheartedly resonate with as a therapist of African American and Puerto Rican descent. Her book resonates with an empowering message of shedding ingrained trauma responses, replacing them with adaptive coping strategies that are holistic, healthy, and far-reaching.\n\nWhat sets this book apart is not only its comprehensive understanding of intergenerational trauma but also its actionable strategies. Dr. Buqué effectively translates her holistic approach into tangible therapeutic practices, creating a guide that is both enlightening and actionable for readers seeking mending and transformation.\nDr. Buqué emerges not only as an expert but as a compassionate teacher, leading readers on a profound journey toward restoration.\n\nOverall, \"Break The Cycle\" is an essential and compelling resource that doesn't just enlighten but empowers readers to take the necessary steps towards healing. She reminds us all that we are cycle breakers and shows us exactly how to sow the seeds of intergenerational abundance. My favorite chapter? Hands down, breaking old parenting patterns! Dr. Buque really breaks down how to care for ourselves while caring for our children at a time when society is dramatically changing and things feel more uncertain then ever.\n\nThank you to the author and publisher for the e-arc copy!\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "I remember being in a retreat, a river of pain pouring out from a person next to me, when the leading therapist asked -\n\n\"is this pain yours?\"\n\nthis is a book about the pain that is not ours, not really, but we got so familiar with it, that it blended into our being, blinding us with the intensity that has been gathering strength for decades, or centuries. it asks not only what happened to you, but also what happened before you, and around you.\n\nit's embarrassing to admit how much I could relate to it. shutting off when what I want the most is reaching out. leaning into my fragile ego when I know I value connection above all. maybe that's why family reunions turn into a tornado of emotional intensity, not only being triggered in familiar ways, but recognising our irrational responses in others, followed by bitter sweet aha-moments: so that is how I learned to shut off!\n\nit shouldn't be embarrassing. I'm hearing the same stories from my friends. I'm seeing the same patterns around me. and it's the book that raises awareness of it, and I believe in the value of awareness greatly. even more importantly, it's a book that encourages action on top of awareness.\n\nit's a workbook of sorts. I expected a set of research studies, clinical stories, biological mechanisms, and I got all of those, but the key focus of the book is active work towards breaking intergenerational cycles of pain. reflection questions, mindfulness exercises, introspective tasks. it's self-help in the literal sense of the word. in the best sense of the word, as it encourages approaching the darkest depths of our history, and seeking nurturing resolution.\n\nmy ancestors handled some inexplicable challenges. my grandpa's brother was deported to Siberia for not complying with Soviet dictatorship. my other grandpa's brother was brought to a concentration camp for not complying with the Nazi regime. my parents grew up in the society where no one trusted anyone, as a word said mindlessly could get you killed. I was raised in the echoes of it.\n\nit's a book helping to hear those echoes for what they are, and learn to create your own music out of them.\nShow more",

        "Review 9": "The case in this book that stood out to me was of a mom, Luna, who supposedly hit her child (who had also come into therapy with her), because I think a lot of people in Dr. Buqué’s position would have difficulty seeing the humanity in someone who engages in physical abuse towards children. In that way, the author demonstrated compassion and used a holistic, nonjudgmental approach to solving this problem - getting to the root of Luna’s problematic behaviours aka the trauma that she herself experienced and was perpetuating towards her child. Here, Luna isn’t regarded as some sort of evil monster, but rather a broken, hurting human who had her own demons to fight and needed to enlist the help of Dr. Buqué.I am slightly skeptical about how effective some of the exercises she listed in the book, especially the affirmations, are, but maybe that’s just the cynic in me. This is why healing from trauma can be a long, arduous, and uncomfortable process, since it already takes so much time and courage to recognize one’s trauma, put a name to it, and potentially even acknowledge our own role in perpetuating trauma in other people’s lives. And it can be awkward to sit in the intense emotions that may pop up as we recall how our parents, grandparents, and other ancestors may have perpetuated harmful habits that continue to impact us today. Being an effective, safe therapist for clients experiencing intergenerational trauma requires a willingness to be fully present with clients in their pain and discomfort, which not everyone has.",
        "Review 10": "Break the Cycle is an excellent self-help book that focuses on the author’s area of specialty, intergenerational trauma. She does a great job gently laying out what intergenerational trauma looks like, how it transfers between members of a lineage, and approaches to breaking and ending the cycle. I found her activities very straightforward, approachable, and useful—especially the intergenerational trauma tree exercise. I also appreciated her weaving in knowledge and healing techniques from different cultures, such as Native American wisdom, Kinyarwanda sayings, singing bowls, etc., including recipes from her own Dominican family.\n\nIntergenerational trauma has become a buzzword of sorts and a hot topic, but what really makes this book special is her emphasis on intergenerational resilience, wisdom, and cultural practices as an essential part of the healing process. She makes sure to point out that we get passed down a lot of good stuff that we could better utilize, too!\n\nShe also maps out a few ways to adapt Western, individualistic therapeutic knowledge to better embrace the realities of intergenerational trauma, such as a different approach to the common “ACEs” inventory that addresses more than just direct, personal trauma.\n\nSome people might find elements or exercises in the book to be a little too “woo-woo” for them. However, there is still plenty of scientific evidence in this book and some more practical, helpful exercises, so I think there is knowledge a wide variety of people could benefit from. Overall, the book was very compassionate and clear. I think there’s a good chance this will become part of the “canon” of psychology self-help books for people dealing with trauma.\n\nThank you so much to Dutton for the advance digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "I was prepared to defend this book. Although Miranda’s experience and beliefs about chronic illness are very different from my own, I was prepared to argue that everybody has their own story and as long as it’s made clear that they’re sharing their own truth and don’t speak for everybody, then there would be no real repercussions. I thought it wrong that people were jumping to conclusions and inciting hostility before the book even came out, so I waited until I read it cover to cover before forming my judgement. And now that I have… I no longer want to defend this book.\n\nTo her credit, Miranda states several times that ME/CFS is a real and serious condition linked to the body’s immune system. She also makes some excellent points about learning to live as your authentic self and (correctly) identifies that levels of stress and insecurity can affect the way our bodies function. However, she leans very heavily into the psychosomatic approach to ‘healing’ and recovery, with the book stating that “Thoughts really can make you feel and stay ill” and “I was going to take responsibility for [following my personal values], those which were curing my body of exhaustion and viruses”.\n\nI’m choosing to focus this review on the book itself rather than the contentious approach to illness it takes, but I will briefly say that it was very difficult and jarring to read about healing yourself through your thoughts when at this very moment young women are losing their lives to M.E. and even more are experiencing gaslighting and abuse from medical professionals who incorrectly psychologise their condition and withdraw care. If anybody happens to read this review who isn’t part of the community and wants to broaden their understanding, I urge you to research the stories of Merryn Crofts, Maeve Boothby, and Sammy Lincroft, only a few of the young women who have lost their lives in recent years.\n\nOf course, no singular person can represent an entire, diverse community, nor should they be expected to. Miranda can only speak on her own experiences, as any of us can, and is perfectly within her rights to share her truth. I’m genuinely glad that she’s doing better and at a much brighter stage in her life. However, I do take issue with the statements she’s making on behalf of everybody living with conditions of this nature. She describes a lot of research findings in the book, so I was very surprised by the absence of citations so that people could do their own further reading and if desired, verify these findings for themselves. Especially as I work for one of the organisations mentioned in the book (though speaking only in a personal capacity here) and was slightly heartbroken to see a finding from our recent research report used in a very different context to how it was intended, to illustrate a point in the book that was very different to the actual research outcomes and implications. But as there was no citation included for this or other claims, readers can only take in what is on the page. I also think this book would have hugely benefitted from a few rounds of sensitivity reading before being published, and I definitely think a more compassionate balance could have been struck between telling Miranda’s personal story and acknowledging those with different lived experiences from her own.\n\nI’m a big fan of Miranda’s work and know how hard it can be to translate all the complexities of your story to the page,but reading parts of this book as somebody with an ongoing chronic illness was difficult and painful. If I’m totally honest, some parts left me feeling worse about myself and my disability status rather than better. However, there were genuinely some positive takeaways from the book, with words on living as your truest self and stepping away from conformity that I found comforting and quite inspiring. Miranda states in the book that she has a newfound sense of purpose to help others and I completely believe she has the power to do a lot of good in this world. But rather than approaching this through her illness beliefs, I hope her work in the future leans into the other side of her story instead. It’s here, speaking on being your truest and most authentic self, where she can and will be a role model for many.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "I too love Miranda, but I cannot support the kind of advice that featured in this book.\n\nAs someone who has suffered from chronic illness for over 15 years I really struggle with the invalidation that comes from \"thinking yourself well\" claptrap. If we just acknowledge we've been too busy, let out all our built up stress and emotions and learn to accept who we are we'll be cured of all our physical symptoms. Unless we're not.\n\nThere is undoubtedly a connection between stress and illness and definitely relaxation and being at peace more has an effect on symptom severity. But no one with a broken leg will be able to fix themselves with mindfulness. No one with the flu gets better overnight after they've meditated. No one tells a diabetic to throw away their medical records, stop identifying as a diabetic and their symptoms will disappear.\n\nNo illnesses are misunderstood as much as those relating to debilitating fatigue, immune system dysfunction and neurological damage. But they are real and whilst the causes are not fully understood these kinds of theories continue to perpetuate the misconceptions surrounding these illnesses.\n\nI am glad Miranda has found happiness and better health and wish her well. But I will not be recommending this book.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "First up - I LOVE Miranda! Always have, probably always will…\n\nAnd, as if it was even possible, I love her all the more after reading this brilliant new book! She is one of the REALISED people I have ever seen in the public eye. She is pure, honest and genuine to her very core. She lifts me up and makes me feel worthy, loved and seen.\n\nWithin this fantastic read, you will hear not only of Miranda’s most troubled time but also the ‘treasures’ she has found during this period of darkness that have lead her to become wildly at home in herself.\n\nSuper easy 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n\nI love Miranda’s writing style because she can write so eloquently and accurately yet, she also has the ability to sneak in humour and jokes at ease. She brings such an uplifting and lighthearted tone to a book that deals with some hefty material. Furthermore, one of the things I loved most about was the structure in which she wrote. As I mentioned before, she writes about ‘treasures’ she has discovered - surrender, thoughts, loving ourselves etc. Each treasure is a chapter and at the beginning of each chapter she shares treasures she has picked up, patterns she has smashed, a watchword and, even a powerful soundtrack to go with it. I found this methodical approach extremely helpful.\n\nShe shares many, many personal stories and experiences which makes this book feel rich with meaning and emotion. Moreover, she shares practical tools, values, ways, answers researched from some great scientists, neuroscientists, therapists, sociologists. She had me laughing and crying in equal measures. I was literally in tears at one point because what she was explaining felt so true to myself. It was like she was writing directly to me 🥺\n\nMiranda speaks passionately throughout the book about ‘Coming home to yourself’ - operating from a place of peace and power, where you are afraid to be who you are rather unbuffered by other others opinions of you or worldly measures of success.\n\n‘If you are digging in among any personal life difficulties at this moment, know that you can be okay. More than okay. You already are. You are fabulous. Fact. Whether you believe it yet or not.’ ♥️\n\nFurthermore, Miranda explains how darkness is a part of life. It cannot be escaped or ignored. It is allowed. We’re allowed to feel, and naturally we will experience a range of emotions from sadness, joy, fear, anger, disappointment, embarrassment and hysterical laughter all within the same day. We are allowed to feel all of these. We cannot simply ignore the darkness.\n\nBut, she then goes on to touch on the bedrock of trust that she gets from her faith, and the love that accompanies this. I found this to be a powerful reminder 🙏🏼\n\n‘Peace is this moment without thinking\nThat it should be some other way,\nThat you should feel some other thing,\nThat your life should unfold according to your plans.\n\nPeace is this moment without judgement,\nThis moment in the heart-space where\nEverything that is is welcome.’ 🙏🏼\n\nI absolutely LOVED this book and have taken a lot from it. Miranda has written an entertaining book filled with important messages and I had SUCH FUN (if you know, you know 😉) reading it. I know I will come back to this book when I am in need of a pick me up.\n\n‘You know how every once in a while you do something and the little voice inside says, “There. That’s it. That’s why you are here…” and you get a warm glow in your heart because you know it’s true? Do more of that.’ - Jacob Nordby 😌\n\nSide note: I seem to be ticking off a lot of ‘Firsts’ - First Non-Fiction book of the Year 📕\nShow more",

        "Review 5": "I love Miranda Hart and everything she stands for, truly I do. I have nothing but respect for the things she's struggled with. I think it was brave of her to tell her story, and I know she's sharing it from a place of compassion and an honest desire to help others. I'm sure that many people who read this book will find it helpful, insightful, and possibly life changing.\n\nThat said, this book was not what I was expecting and just wasn't for me. It seemed like Miranda was mostly expounding upon things she'd gleaned from various medical and mental health sources, and oftentimes rambled on for way too long before she got around to the point. It too often came across as \"If we all do this, we'll feel so much better.\" Again, I know Miranda was coming at this with all the best intentions, but that sort of \"advice\" can sometimes make people feel worse or even more isolated because they've already tried these things but perhaps did not meet with the same level of success, or simply lack the resources to fully access or apply such assistance.\n\nI wanted to like this book, but about a third of the way in I couldn't do it anymore. I wish Miranda all the best, and I'm happy for her. But I'm giving this book a pass.\n\n\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "I rarely give books a one star but this took the biscuit. Miranda has definitely been through the ringer with years lost to chronic illness which she finally disclosed as ME induced Lyme Disease.\n\nThe book is publicised as a memoir but there is very little genuine connection to Miranda as a human being. It is self help through her treasures and the Miranda persona/character. Don't read this is you looking for a Maggie O'Farrell or Hilary Mantel memoir on illness. This is not Susan Sontag!\n\nOne can feel the selling machine of the publicity machine all over this. The arc is contrived and convenient - it starts with her collapse and how she doesn't know what to do, then she goes on her journey of 10 treasures and by the end claims recovery and now knows what to do in a time of crisis or collapse. There's no mention that anyone should maybe seek medical help if they collapse not Miranda's book!\n\nThe tone is cloying and saccharine with the release of her diagnosis and marriage all conveniently revealed for her book launch and comeback re- entry into Telly land after her years of being ill. This might be a bit cynical but it feels like due to this period of economic activity she is writing the book for financial reasons and not for the chronic illness community. I kind of felt used even reading it.\n\nBut there is just some really strange advice that seems directed at anyone with chronic illness (which is alot of people). She refuses to say Lyme or any diagnosis terms as it might perpetuate her symptoms. She burns all her medical records so she doesn't identity with her illness. And she gives up all other medical involvement and relies on brain rewiring or brain retraining which basically is some pseudoscience mind-body thing where you have to stop all your fear and unsafe thoughts, emotions and feelings to stop being ill.\n\nApparently the root cause of her Lyme is her inability to say no and she might let people down??!\n\nShe even claims Mediterranean people live longer and can eat all the pizza they like because they release their emotions (she obviously hasn't met any Japanese). And if you project bad or good thoughts over rice and bluebells the plants/food reciprocally thrive or die?!?\n\nSelf help and positive advice for those with chronic illness yes, linking it to recovery and how to treat illness is a bit far fetched. But you can see Miranda is fully convinced of this. And one can understand why if she's been told she was anxious and agoraphobic by doctors for so long. But all the ISTs as she calls them are basically fringe mind-body folk who are not well recognised.\n\nI genuinely feel sorry for anyone who is going to get this for Christmas. It's kooky and is just going to continue the gaslighting cycle as people blame themselves, their fear, insecurity or lack of attached relationships for their illness\n\nSome of the more perplexing quotes:\n\n“As I burned records and journals, I honoured my story with a grief I hadn't allowed from the start. (I was veritably Spanish).”\n\n\n“if we're constantly repeating a story like “I'm so exhauted’ our physiology will respond and it will affect our mood and disorder. MIND BLOWING. The number of times I would say things like, “it's like wading through treacle,” or “ its such a battles. Now, phrases like that make me feel instantly weak…Eventually I stopped saying Lyme or any of the other diagnostic words…to reduce its power.”\n\n\n“Why do you want to get better? When one of these specialists, or should I say the specialist ‘ists’ (bitt of fun), on brain retraining to reduce the chronic stress response said that to me, i knew it was important but considered it in some ways rather cruel…The IST continued that without a clear answer to that question, it would be hard for me to recover.” (TBH her brain training therapist sounds like a manipulative arse who's got her wrapped round his little finger which is awful as she's so vulnerable.)\n\n\n“I already believed the treasures to be right and true, but to experience them all in a 10-minute moment in my garden to placate myself was extraordinary…I now knew what to do in any moment of chronic crisis. I knew what to do in the next 10 minutes. All the treasures releasing me. Wow.”\n\n\n“It's not the disease causing the symptoms, it's our brain. MIND BLOWING.”\n\n\nShe just ends up sounding deluded TBH through the whole book, taken in by pseudoscience grifters. I feel quite sorry for her.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Awful, harmful advice.\n\nBrain rewiring does NOT cure your physiological illness.

        "Review 9": "I’m sorry I cannot read another page of this book! Also annoyed because it was expensive! The book so far is trite and irritating, comprised mainly of the contents of other self-help books. It’s not what I expected at all. If there had been more of herself rather than second-hand unoriginal mumbo-jumbo then I might have persevered. Crikey - steer clear. Life is far too short",
        "Review 10": "One of my many many bones to pick with this book was that for the audio they changed what I can only assume was ‘my dear reader chum’ to ‘my dear listener chum’, perpetuating the common assertion that audiobooks somehow don’t count as reading? The audio edit also meant you could hear noticeable jumps and shifts in voice, when they’ve clearly gone back in to add certain caveats about massively generalised statements after the initial recording session.\n\nAddressing these serious health concerns, and claiming that symptoms come from the brain and not the disease is ‘mindblowing’ indeed! As someone suffering from many of the same long-term conditions as Miranda including chronic Lyme, chronic pain and PoTS, I’m genuinely quite insulted by the way she dismisses very real physical reactions as being able to be thought away?! Incredibly disappointing on so many levels. I bought this book after watching her speak on Graham Norton (I’m not historically a Miranda fan as her comedy isn’t my style), but reading this burned away any of the positive response I’d felt from what had been an emotional interview. Considering how hard it is to get people (medical professionals and the general public alike) to acknowledge that these chronic illnesses even exist, with so much misinformation and jokes spread, this book does nothing at all to help the cause, and does a great disservice to so many suffering with debilitating symptoms over many years.\n\nI’m glad she’s doing better, but claiming you can think yourself well of these kinds of illnesses is NOT someone who is being ‘entirely honest’.\nShow more"

The marketing sets you up for raw, unfiltered vulnerability, but instead, you get carefully curated anecdotes and motivational advice from someone who feels like she’s still figuring it out. There’s power in hearing her reflect on her childhood as a breadwinner and the public scrutiny she’s endured, but it’s hard to hear her blame herself for “triggering” an ex who harmed her.

        "Review 5": "Sorry to this book, but this is not a memoir…\n\nI was so excited to see that Keke Palmer had written a memoir. She is such a joy and I’ve loved hearing her outlook on life via her podcast/social media. I listened to the audiobook because I simply love to hear the woman speak, and sure she did make me laugh a few times. But this book had zero (zilch) vulnerability and basically no details about her life that you couldn’t already find on Wikipedia.\n\nIt read mostly as a self-help book, so I don’t know why it wasn’t marketed as such. I mean seriously, what kind of “memoir” includes end of section multiple choice quizzes re self worth and related topics. It’s like Keke not only doesn’t want to share any potentially vulnerable details about her life, but also has no faith that the audience could learn lessons from her life stories, so instead of giving us any actual life stories she gave a lot of platitudes and explicitly stated the lesson she wanted us to learn. And then there would be random chapters that felt like drawn out ads for one of her multiple businesses (I’m looking at you, ch 26).\n\nThis is not to say that the public is entitled to all of Keke’s life and its intimate details. But it’s misleading to publish a book, call it a memoir, and pretend that the reader is going to gain some new insight into someone’s life and then this be the result.

It’s a self-help book that partially separates the person from the celebrity. I wouldn’t say Keke let us all the way in with this one, but there are definitely some takeaways from this book that can be applied immediately to readers lives.\n \nWith mentions of Whoopi Goldberg, Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Bette Midler, Jordan Peele, and many more, Keke tells us how these people played into her story, directly and indirectly.

Hardly any discussion regarding medication because penn only tried one and didn’t like it and never had to go back on it again, this is bad advice imo for adhders because the majority of us do not have a million dollars to quit our jobs and become Internet personalities and medication is the #1 life changing factor for the majority of us that allows us to function and stay on task.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "This is probably one of the most interesting reviews that I’ve ever sat down to write. It’s very easy, you see, to write a review about a piece of fiction. It’s also easy, I think, to review non-fiction related to history, education, politics, or a memoir. And I guess I always feel a little weird when I’m reviewing something that could be classified as a self-help memoir. Often, I’ve found myself measuring books like this based on the quality of the support provided and I generally don’t read them incredibly often.\n\nADHD is Awesome is the sort of book I sit down with feeling as though I learned a lot and found quite a large amount of it useful—whether to myself or my partner—but am also cognizant of how very personalized the story is due to the numerous personal experiences highlighted on by the authors.\n\nSuffice to say, I think that this entire book is very useful. I think there is a lot of information that can be gleaned from it and it was certainly far more of an entertaining read than your typical ADHD support book. That said, there are also sections that feel as though they contain more fluff than is really necessary. And ultimately, I think it’s important to take the authors at their word: this is not the end all be all of ADHD books. It’s a tips and tricks sort of book with a side of personal stories with the hope that readers may find pieces of the advice useful in their day to day. It’s a positive hype up to support those who have negative feelings about their diagnosis or life struggles.\n\nAnd there’s a lot of merit in that.\n\nBut if you’re reading this because you’re hoping this will be the one and only book you have to read about ADHD, it’s probably not going to do what you want it to.\n\nAs an educator who works daily with a large variety of students, many who have very similar struggles, a lot of the information in this book rang true for how we should treat children. In fact, much of what I do as an educator to encourage and support fell in line with a lot of what Holderness said about how we should be treating our ADHD adults. It’s such a wonderful thing to see and a truly interesting topic of conversation to have.\n\nWhy is it we talk so much about encouragement and positive reinforcement with children and not adults? I think it has generally been proven over and over again that this approach is the best possible one you could have. It’s across the board with children, with adults, with dogs, with everyone. If nothing else, I think that is the most important takeaway to leave this book with.\n\nI received a copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "ADHD IS awesome, but this book wasn't for me.\n\nI checked this book out to help me understand my husband who has ADHD more. My husband is brilliant but doesn't do well with conventional studying and clashes at times with my messy craft disasters.\n\nThis book rubbed me the wrong way because the author, Penn, was really only describing and using anecdotes from his own side of the spectrum of ADHD. He continues to play up this lovable duffus character that he uses to describe himself. This is almost the exact opposite of how my husband expresses his ADHD. While Penn and Kim continue to remark that ADHD is a spectrum I couldn't connect any of their anecdotes to how me and my husband deal with his ADHD.\n\nMy husband is quiet, shy, always researching and enriching himself. He is a bit of a dare devil and loves mastering any sport or skill that involves a motor. Such as, motorcycles, cars, putting an engine into a lawn mower, etc. He also did firefighting and EMT to get his adrenaline fix before COVID. Currently he's learning Japanese like it's his second job and getting ready to rally his car.\n\nHe told me he was a renaissance man when I met him. Meaning his focus changes rapidly and he likes to be good at many things instead of great at one thing.\n\nAll that being said, I am being kind when I say \"my husband and Penn could never be friends\". Their ADHDs clash too much and I don't think I gained any insight reading this book.\n\nI really hope it helps others though\nShow more",

It's written from the perspective of someone who actually lives with it, though they admit it can look a bit different for everyone. I feel like I learned some things and took away solid suggestions. They do speak to caregivers in how you can support a child with ADHD as well, which is helpful. I'll admit it does read a little bit like a parentified relationship in this marriage, but they also seem to be aware of that and trying to modify it as much as they can. Not the only thing to read, but I'm glad I picked it up.\nShow more",

My fiancé has hyperactive ADHD like Holderness (and is medicated) and has only exhibited a fraction of the chaos that Holderness seems to generate.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "This is one of the most informative and enjoyable books about ADHD I have read to date.\n\nPenn Holderness and Kim Holderness are the husband and wife team that wrote and narrated the book like a podcast. By the way, they have a podcast called The Holderness Family podcast, of all things!\n\nPlaying to those of us who have ADHD, the pace is fast and lively. Yet quite conversational. In this case, the person with ADHD was the husband, and the loving wife put up with his antics. I think what they presented was universal. I would like to see this done with a female with ADHD as the circumstances change drastically. But the family tried to point out some of those differences.\n\nThe best part, besides the camaraderie, was some of the ways the ADHDers or their families and friends can conquer, change, or make allowances for all that energy and distraction. Kim showed that she wasn't a saint but learned ways to help her husband become a super-daddy, husband, co-worker, or friend by offering supportive ideas.\n\nI was lucky enough to find this audiobook on Libby, but I plan to buy my own paper and Audible copies soon. I could use a many-layered approach. If you want to better understand this superpower and/or disability, I think you would enjoy this.\nShow more"

It included a lot of science like brain anatomy and signalling pathways which I wasn’t expecting, but for me personally, it was fine since I have previous knowledge in these areas. Gemma explained the science in basic terms which I think would be super easy to understand to someone who isn’t familiar with it, but it may be a lot to grasp for them. Anyway, she had some really good thoughts in the book about mental health which I guess was the overall topic, but she did go off into other areas as well. Love you Gem 🥹\nShow more",

Her ability to weave personal anecdotes with broader psychological concepts makes the book both relatable and informative.\n\nStyles' writing is engaging and accessible, making it easy for readers to connect with her experiences and reflections. The book is filled with moments of introspection and clarity that encourage readers to reflect on their own lives and experiences. While some parts felt a bit repetitive, the overall message of self-acceptance and growth shines through beautifully.\n\nThis book is a must-read for anyone looking to understand themselves better and feel less alone in their struggles.

For anyone who has felt at odds with their own mind and brain—maybe that it’s failed you or somehow have come to the belief that you screwed it up along the way, this one is for you…for us.\n\nAs someone who has spent well over a decade battling through anxiety, depression, and ocd I have come in contact with a fair share of books about mood disorders and/or self help. I will 100% stand by the fact that this is the first book I read where I didn’t feel like I was getting talked at, but rather feeling like I’ve come in contact with a long lost friend who slowly takes me on a guided tour of my brain and it’s functions while slowly dispersing insight about the evolution, purpose and necessity of these said functions all in regards to the modern world. Gemma did such an incredible job at breaking down large daunting facts of information and presenting it in a way that’s accessible. Her thorough examples, whether fictional or drawn from her personal experience, bring a level of clarity and realness.\n\nI’ve internally beaten myself up for years about feeling too sensitive, confused as to why my brain reacts differently in certain situations than my peers, or put off by my internal thought process, that then makes me question why am I like this (hence the title!), and this book provides reasonings and validations.\n\nThere is a beauty to this book through and through that leaves you feeling hopeful by the end. You gain a newfound understanding of your brain which has allowed myself to be more patient, give myself grace in situations where I haven’t in the past. This is a book about learning to love your brain, complexities and all, which in turn takes you on a journey to heal and love yourself again.\n\nGemma, thank you for sharing your story, and for writing this book. This is a book that has allowed me to take the hands of my past self and make amends with her, while gearing up and educating my present day self to stay hopeful about my future self!🥹♥️✨\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "Interesting and candid account of a therapist's life touching on five heavily fictionalised patients. I found it very readable and it felt honest, plus he's a good and entertaining storyteller. Although there has to be a point where constantly analysing your own thoughts must drive you crackers.",
        "Review 2": "2024 reads, #19. DID NOT FINISH. I’ve been a big fan of the psychotherapy process ever since starting my own sessions back in 2015, so much so that I’ve spent a lot of time vaguely thinking about what it would be like to become a therapist myself (which, to be clear, I’m not planning on doing, because I’m already in my mid-fifties and wouldn’t want to yet again start all over in my career like that). That’s had me reading and really enjoying a number of books over the years by therapists specifically about the therapy process, mostly by the brilliant Irvin Yalom (but for more, see my reviews of Love’s Executioner , Creatures of a Day , and Staring at the Sun ), as well as that contemporary book that got so much traction several years ago, Lori Gottlieb’s Maybe You Should Talk to Someone .\n\nThat made me think that Joshua Fletcher’s brand-new And How Does That Make You Feel? would be right up my alley, a book that promises to be a similar behind-the-scenes look at what an actual therapist is going through in their own head as they go through the process of analyzing and helping their clients, which I had especially high hopes for because it took forever for my name to finally come to the top of the reserve list at the Chicago Public Library, and typically books that popular tend to be pretty good as well. But alas, this turned out to be almost worthless, because Fletcher doesn’t actually provide any insights whatsoever here, but instead presents his inner voice as a series of “little people who live inside him” -- yes, just like the Disney children’s movie -- then doesn’t give these little people anything more insightful to say than such facile, obvious, kneejerk reactions like, “I’m scared of this guy!”, “I’m proud of her!”, and “I really have to pee!”\n\nJesus Christ, bro, are you telling me that a professional full-time therapist has absolutely nothing more interesting to share about their profession than childish little quips about his clients’ physical attributes and whether or not they stammer while they talk? Then again, I suppose this is partly my fault for not actually reading Fletcher’s bio before picking up the book, where I would’ve seen him proudly talking about his popular TikTok account; and that’s all a grown-up needs to hear to now know that they’re dealing with a glorified man-child and not an actual grown-up, which is exactly what this book feels like, like a little child trying to explain psychotherapy in ten-second snippets while doing his cutesy little cheerleader dance or whatever the hell those TikTok children are into these days. This is now the third contemporary book in a single week I’ve been forced to give up on before even making it 25 pages in, which makes me want to never pick up a book published after 2020 again the entire rest of my life; and while I know already that I won’t actually stick to that threat, certainly it’s just more evidence to me of how completely and totally contemporary literature has now permanently fallen into a disastrous pit of unreadable schlock, as we now all just become inured to a world where the marketing sociopaths are now the ones making all the book acquisition decisions anymore, and they aren’t greenlighting anyone who doesn’t have a TikTok account and writes at a third-grade level. Avoid, avoid, avoid; for the love of all that is holy, avoid.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Compulsively readable. Loved Fletcher breaking down his inner thoughts into “inner voices” instead. I felt it was profound at times, too on the nose at others, and an overall faithful and human depiction of the therapeutic hour.",
        "Review 4": "\"We’re in a global mental health crisis, and unfortunately many people feel disillusioned after their first attempt at therapy. To me, saying this is the equivalent of saying “I tried sports and I didn’t like it” when all you played was lawn bowling, once.\" Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the closed door of the therapist's office? What's revealed there may surprise you.\n\nSimilar to Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, this book delves into what goes on behind the doors of psychotherapist Joshua Fletcher's doors. This includes his personal thoughts, feelings and behaviors towards clients as well as these stories from his highly regarded clients. Structured around four client case studies, Joshua Fletcher lifts the veil of secrecy around an often-misunderstood profession. He details, with care and compassion, his clients’ nonlinear path to health and healing, as he works with them to overcome their anxiety. Along the way, Joshua chronicles the voices in his own head that act both as a hindrance and a guide in his treatments. He also educates his audience on anxiety and psychotherapy, explaining the origins of anxiety and the different modalities of therapy, in the hopes of normalizing the conversation around mental health.\n\n\"It’s important to remember that therapists are as human as everybody else. It’s okay to see them like any other human inside or outside the therapy room. Therapists don’t have everything worked out. We are flawed, we have our vices, and we constantly work on our own personal stuff.\" As a therapist, I couldn't have said it better myself. This book offers a glimpse into the not-so-scary side of therapy. \"I promise that there is no omnipotent know-it-all waiting for you on the other side of the therapy-room door, ready to pounce at the first chance to judge or shame you. Instead, the person who awaits you is, ideally, someone who wants to listen and is willing to be a conscientious, nonjudgmental guest in your world for a short while.\"\n\nFletcher does an excellent job of portraying the often misinterpreted field of therapy. He honestly and vulnerably portrays himself as a human doing his best while trying to maintain positive human regard, professionalism, and hope for each of his clients. Throughout four client stories, we see what it's like to be in the intimate of rooms: the therapy office.\n\n\"Good therapy—beautiful therapy—is a life-enhancing experience as much as it is a remedial or mitigating experience. Good therapy is a gift.\" Highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in therapy, mental health, self help, anxiety...I. could go on and on.\n\nThanks to NetGalley, Harper Collins & Joshua Fletcher for the ARC in exchange for my honest review.

        "Review 5": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Having been to a few therapists myself over the years (PTSD, anxiety, depression), I always wondered what they were thinking as I spilled my feelings. Did they think I was weird? Am I an anomaly? How do they know what to say/do?\nThankfully, Fletcher has written this book to explain it all. How therapy works (or doesn't), how there's not a one size fits all category of therapist, what they are trying to do to help us. And, lo and behold, they're not invincible to the same feelings./disorders as us.\nHe does this through telling about several case studies. ALL of them were fascinating! And his methods of trying to pull out of us what the problem's roots are.\nAnd he discusses his own problems too! His own personal demons and foibles. How he tries to work through them. And all with a sense of humor that I found to be appreciated.\nAll in all, the book left me with the confidence that, if I ever needed therapy again, I would be much more secure and less apprehensive about it.\nI encourage people to read this.

Also, I didn’t need a 101 level primer on every different type of diagnosis like anxiety, OCD, etc.\n\ni felt bad about his brother, but the way in which he told the story made it simply feel like a gimmicky construct for this book.

        "Review 2": "I rarely write reviews, but this book feels like a personal insult to readers’ intelligence and ethics.\n\nI first heard about Let Them on Oprah’s show, where it was praised as one of the best books she'd ever read. Intrigued by the endorsement, I gave it a try—and quickly regretted my decision.\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room: this idea is far from revolutionary. Philosophers like the Stoics—and countless others—have articulated this concept for centuries: accept what you must, control what you can, and make empowered choices rooted in reality. Packaging this timeless wisdom as a “theory” feels not only gimmicky but borderline disrespectful to the rich history of these teachings.\n\nBut the real problem is deeper. Let Them borrows heavily—if not entirely—from a poem by Cassie Phillips, shared online long before Mel's viral video. In that video, Mel casually mentions she \"heard something\" before launching into what is essentially Let Them, the poem. Instead of properly crediting the original author, Mel parlayed the phrase into a book deal and, shockingly, fabricated a story on Oprah, claiming the concept was inspired by her daughter's reaction—a cascade of \"Let Them(s)\". This blatant erasure of Cassie Phillips is unacceptable. Where is the acknowledgement of her work?\n\nTo the Mel Robbins cult, I encourage you to read all the provided links before defending the former lawyer. You seek facts—well, they’re all right here. I am not responsible for how they make you feel, just as you cannot twist the truth to suit your comfort.\n\nEDIT: Cassie is rightly suing Mel: https://www.facebook.com/cassie.sturg...?\n\nUPDATE (it’s worse than I originally thought):\n(1) https://open.substack.com/pub/sagejus...?\n(2) https://open.substack.com/pub/sagejus...?\n\nMel’s approach feels calculated. This isn’t the first time she’s used a dramatic backstory to sell a book, but this time, the cracks are glaring. The result is a shallow, ego-driven cash grab, devoid of nuance and authenticity. It’s another reminder that hype often overshadows substance, and popularity doesn’t equate to originality.\n\nI’m astonished this book was published.

        "Review 3": "This is the worst book that I will read in 2025. I can write this with confidence - in January - because it is one of the worst books I have read in my life, and I have just turned 56.\n\nIf you want to understand how Donald Trump became President... If you want to understand why there is a focus on influencers rather than intelligent people who know what they are doing... If you want to understand the decontexualization of poverty or homelessness... Then this is your book.\n\nWhat is happening? Let's do this...\n\nWe have an under-performing, under-educated woman summoning under-refereed research to offer a commentary about life. Her own life has been punctuated by a series of failures. Yet she then uses these failures from her husband and children to create a 'theory.'\n\nPlease note: the word 'theory' is used in the title. This is not a 'theory'. What is offered is a vibe. An opinion. A data set of one. The idea that readers know so little that this vibe is accepted as a theory - shows why we are in the mess we are in...\n\nLet's present some evidence about this book... Which is what this book does not do.\n\nHere are the edited highlights of this book:\n\n“How I changed my life”\n\n“I knew I wanted to teach the 5 second rule full time and somehow make this my career, but I didn’t know how. l Looking back, I can see how paralysed I was with imposter syndrome. What right did I have to call myself an expert in anything?”\n\n“When people would ask if I had a Ph.D or if I was a therapist, I would say, “No, I learned everything the hard way – by screwing up my own life and then having to fix it”\n\n“I’ve been told over and over again that I have this amazing ability to distill complex ideas and scientific research into simple, actionable advice that anyone can use to improve their life”\n\n“I have made it my mission to find and share many simple tools to help anyone create a better life”\n\n“The truth is, other people hold no real power over you unless you give it to them”\n\n“No matter what is happening … you still hold the power”\n\n“People do what they feel like doing”\n\n“Let Them struggle”\n\n\"Chris [her husband] had developed a major problem with alcohol. He was drinking away the stress and engaging in other self-destructive behaviors. He was depressed, anxious, and knew he could no longer live like this”\n\n“I was speaking to my therapist, Anne, about this.”\n\n“You have the power.\"\n\n“You can have the life you’ve always wanted. You can be a millionaire.”\n\n“No one else can stop you. It’s all on you.”\n\nMy new t-shirt slogan in life is - things could be worse. You could be Chris. You could be married to Mel Robbins and have your life, and your weaknesses and fears presented in a truly rubbish self help book.\n\nOn behalf of all the people who have lost their lives through homelessness, grief, tragedy and death, you know what, Mel? Sometimes, we don't have the power. Sometimes, we don't want to be a millionaire. Sometimes, we have been treated like rubbish by late capitalism and lost our lives, our love, our hopes, our future.\n\nLet them in not a theory. It is nonsense. It is a vibe. She has thrown her own family under a bus to offer an opinion.\n\nThis book is a warning for academics. Actual scholars. Not #randoms doing Ted talks. If we do not disseminate our research widely and appropriately, a mediocre woman whose career highlight is a Ted talk and an Oprah interview will end up offering advice to the next generation.\n\nLet's not - Let Them. Let's commit to research. Let's commit to theory. Let's commit to interpretation. Let's commit to ideas beyond an individual. Let's understand history and geography and meaning.\n\nLet us be defiant scholars. Who believe in the world. Not rehashing the stories of one woman and her family.\n\nChris - we're with you.\nShow more",

I also think in theory “let them” sounds nice but I found a lot of flaws in it. Aside from that I must say I am biased here because I personally hate self help books. To me they give the same energy as 35-45 year old woman sharing “inspiring” quotes on Facebook. I don’t know how else to explain it, but if you get it, you get it.

I’ll have to come back to the book, highlight and re-read and take it all in.\n\nApart from being full of excellent and freeing advice, it felt like this huge therapy session! I felt comforted, understood, seen, like I was given tools and directions! Like, this wasn’t some theories and empty talk book that you read and have no idea how to actually apply anything from it.. It was practical, actionable, doable!\n\nMel is also so incredibly vulnerable and honest, and her ability to show up as this flawed person and still show love and kindness for herself, and the fact that *I* see her faults and still like her - it really gives you proof and permission to be just as you are. To accept and forgive that previous version, to know and express you have issues and have made mistakes - but does not make you any less lovable or less of a person.\nThis whole book serves as a reminder that the best is yet to come, that we really do - live and learn -\nand that every new day, no matter our age or situation; is the opportunity to choose better for ourselves and those around us.\n\nA perfect book to start the new year with & one I’ll be recommending over and over again!\nThank you, Mel, this was incredible and so full of value !!! 🩷\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "In Chapter 6, Haidt casually implies that more young people than ever are identifying as transgender or gender expansive due to \"social contagion\" theory. This theory posits that if your friends are transgender, you will become transgender. Social contagion is the root of the right-wing transphobic talking point of \"rapid onset gender dysphoria,\" which is the false claim of increasing numbers of children suddenly identifying as trans and then accessing hormones and surgery.\n\nIn a 400-page book full of discussion on the gendered differences found among Gen Z users of social media and their mental health, Haidt spends approximately four paragraphs discussing the existence of transgender people. The three main text paragraphs are used to introduce rapid onsent gender dysphoria as legitimate: \"...[T]he fact that gender dysphoria now appears in social clusters (such as a group of close friends), the fact that parents and those who transition back to their natal sex identify social media as a major source of information and encouragement, and the fact that gender dysphoria is now being diagnosed among many adolescents who showed no signs of it as children all indicate that social influence and sociogenic transmission may be at work as well.\" To back up these claims, Haidt cites a widely-discredited and debunked article on the phenomenon of rapid onset gender dysphoria which has been taken up by the right wing to pass anti-trans legislation. Haidt also fails to interview any transgender individuals for the book, despite inclusion of interviews with cisgender individuals throughout.\n\nAs of this book's publishing, 24 states have banned gender affirming care for youth. We know access to gender-affirming care is lifesaving and no child is walking into a doctor's office and leaving with hormones in hand. We also know about the disproportionate rate of anxiety, depression, suicide, and substance use disorders among LGBTQ+ youth. This book is lazy journalism at best and outright transphobic propaganda at worst.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "4 Stars\n\nReviewing this book in a way that seems appropriate feels like a heavy lift that I'm just not capable of doing right now...and it's been a minute since I've read this, so I just want to get something down before this turns into an \"RTC\" in perpetuity review. So off we go...I apologize in advance for how crappy I'm sure this will be.\n\nI was excited to read this because - to be blunt - I basically wanted to be able to speak intelligently about something I already believe: that social media is evil.\n\nAnd before I get slammed for the hypocrisy of posting this here, hold your horses.\n\nI am aware that goodreads is technically a social media site.\nBut it's not Tik Tok.\nIt's not Instagram.\nIt's not YouTube.\n\nCan it be just as destructive as any of those if someone gets overly invested and attached? Sure.\n\nBut for the purposes of this review - and much like Haidt did in this book - when I reference social media, I am referring mainly to all the Tik Toks and Instagrams out there.\n\nCause they are the parasites that are truly contributing to the ever-increasing rotting of our society. And yes, I really believe that. Just like I believed giving everyone a participation trophy was a bad idea back in the early 2000s.\n\nDo I think social media has its upsides? infinitesimally. And definitely not enough to offset the downsides. Cause our brains and minds were not meant to operate this way. It's just that simple.\n\nI thought the way Haidt unpacked the critical milestones and transitions periods of childhood was very well said and well researched. And the way he compared pre-smart phone childhoods to post-smart phone childhoods was very interesting.\n\nI very much enjoyed the earlier and middle portions of this book overall. As I stated above, everything was very well-stated and well-researched. I did think some parts were a bit redundant. And his solution plan...while admirable and logical...I just don't know how it would get it done, sadly.\n\nRegardless, I think this is a must read, especially for parents.\n\nMental Illness, narcissism, and just an overall failure to launch has because an appropriate norm. And it's scary. Your friends and followers don't need to see every meal you ate on vacation or how many times you breathed in and out today. And they don't need a daily discourse about the status of your mental health. Stop navel-gazing. Seriously. It's ridiculous. We need to all get a grip and get the fuck off our phones.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Children should not have smartphones and social media until they are 16.\n\nAs a parent of a young child, I read this book with interest and horror. This book is about the tragic great rewiring that was inflicted on Gen Z between 2010 and 2015 that completely upended them from a normal childhood and caused a generational mental health crisis. The author does a good job of explaining himself with good research and makes a compelling case against a phone-based childhood and praises the virtues of a play-based childhood. I think this book was very good and important but I didn’t agree with everything and think some of his reasoning is actually fallacious when it comes to “helicopter” parenting, which I’ll get into.\n\nDepression, self harm and anxiety are undoubtedly higher in Gen Z and have a sharp rise in boys and girls in 2010 and thereafter. One could speculate that these children grew up after the 9/11 era and after the 2008 financial crisis but, as the author argues, every generation has socio-economic upheaval but doesn't typically result in dramatic drop in mental health. The most likely, and obvious, explanation is that their childhood became steeped in toxic self comparisons on social media (affecting girls more) and video game and pornography addiction (affecting boys more.) Social media is a strategic, asynchronous, disembodied interaction with the aims of fostering and protecting an individual's self brand. Social media platforms are the most efficient conformity machines ever invented where a user can literally gauge approval by numerical likes and views. This is really bad for everyone and basically inhumane to expose a child’s brain to this type of thinking. When a child starts doing this around the age of 10, they chase the dopamine hit of views and likes and sink the enormous opportunity of real-life social interactions and development that prepare them for adulthood. Social media doesn’t just correlate with poor mental health, it is causative. I think the author demonstrates this beyond doubt.\n\nChildren have “defend mode” and “discovery mode”, both useful but the former gets engaged more with a phone based childhood. Free and unsupervised play foster the discovery mode where children learn how to navigate not only the three dimensional space but relationships and their own feelings. A phone based childhood constantly puts a child in defend mode which spills over to real life and chronic anxiety. Social media inflicts sleep deprivation and social deprivation along with attention fragmentation and addiction. Again, these things are awful on an already socialized adult, imagine the cost on a child’s mind that has many years to go before adult brain development.\n\nAccording to the author, there are real gender differences between boys and girls which are almost certainly sociogenic (culturally created) and these differences account for the disparate impact of a phone based childhood on boys and girls. Girls strive for communion and relationship building where boys strive for self autonomy and actualization. These culturally programmed desires I believe are functionally very real. Girl aggression is relational which explains why social media impacts them more than for boys. Take all the self comparison to airbrush models on magazine covers from the 70s and now put that on hyperdrive, socialize it over a screen, adding cyber bullying and dopamine addiction, and you will have a very sad, lonely and anxious girl. For boys, video games can fragment their socialization and silo it off into asynchronous relationships that then addict and hamper their growth. The easy access to pornography, while impacting both boys and girls, seems to hit boys harder who consume it at very early ages.\n\nHere’s where I have a problem with this book: the author creates a false dilemma between a play-based childhood and phone-based childhood. These two things are not mutually exclusive and the author likes to partition them off like they are the only two options. As a parent who is very involved with my child’s life, I take umbrage with the term “helicopter parent” which the author uses. This well intentioned author asserts many times in this book that during the 1980s, parents become overprotective and stopped letting their kids have autonomy. My first response is what!?. This overt generalization is overtly speculative and laughably simplistic. In my opinion, having more parental presence, particularly when it comes to safety, is not hampering children’s socialization and growth. I’m not joking here: the author thinks kids should be able to play in junkyards and with fire, unsupervised. Without presenting much evidence, he talks about the statistic improbability of your child being really harmed or kidnapped. Okay, but what about the stakes? They are enormous. I think it's a parents responsibility to protect them from catastrophe, regardless of how unlikely because the stakes are absolutely enormous. The author creates a false dichotomy that you either must let your children roam the streets unsupervised or put a phone in front of their faces. Of course, this is not true. There is an entire spectrum of parenting, one which could involve letting children roam under freeway overpasses while also sticking a phone in front of their noses for 6 hours a day. I found his take on this bizarre and his assertions that parent’s are hampering their children’s development with over supervision mostly unsupported. “Helicopter parenting” has become a term used by parents who don’t actively engage with their children. Anyway, I digress.\n\nThe solutions the author offers are very good: no social media or smart phones before age 16 and phone free schools. He also laments the loss of spirituality and suggests we need to engage more in shared sacredness, self transcendence (the literal opposite of social media), be slow to anger and quick to forgive (never happens on social media) and to find awe in nature. Overall, I think this was a very good book that everyone should read.\nShow more",

        "Review 5": "I was so excited about this book and could not feel more let down. The science is presented as misleading evidence for causal inference and the citations for some of the boldest claims are weak - citing Haidt’s own Substack, analyses that Haidt says he ran but never published, work in age groups that aren’t the ones under discussion, and more.\n\nThere is also a pervasive unchecked privilege throughout the book - and its recommendations - that is cringe-worthy. These are not recommendations for all families and the work could do way more to acknowledge that. A psychologist should know better.\n\nMy most generous interpretation is that Haidt feels strongly about this topic but the book was pushed out before a rigorous scientific platform was really there. The result feels like a work that should be classified as an opinion piece, not as psychological science.\nShow more",

        "Review 7": "Dang - I think this is one of those books everyone should read.",
        "Review 8": "Where to begin with this? This is a book that has a very specific hypothesis and sticks to it, regardless of whether or not the data employed to advance that argument is accurate or, indeed, based upon robust measures of what is being reported as the problem. This is a shame as the overall argument - that technology has “rewired” childhood for the worse - is one that many parents will want to hear and have their own suspicions confirmed. Well, this book will do that for many a reader despite its flaws.\n\nIt opens with a spurious example of kids settling Mars - spoiler: it doesn’t go well as our bodies are not adapted to a different environment, and those future hypothetical settlers of Mars are unlikely to be well adapted to return to Earth. But the drive to achieve something new is often driven by forces which do not have the best intentions for humans at heart. Essentially the thought experiment uses physiognomy as a parallel to social media use, which is dubious at best. The supposed blame being levelled at technology firms for harming children in the opening gambit seems to lack a consideration of any and all forms of regulatory or legal oversights in its rush to make a questionable situation seem far worse than it is.\n\nDoes it get much better than this? Not really.\n\nInstead of asking who it was that enabled access to technology, devices and services (surely the domain of parents?), the writer goes straight into the blame game, levelling this square at the door of social media site creators, video game makers, and pornographers. Reading this left me baffled. While there are genuine reasons for not wanting kids to spend time engaging with material that’s inappropriate for them, I was perplexed as to how the age limits imposed on these products by third parties and the lack of parental control were seldom mentioned. It’s as if the kids mentioned were able to gorge themselves unrestrained on all-you-can-eat buffet of uncensored digital content. Parental controls have existed since I was a teenager so how come they aren’t being considered, never mind enforced? Is it because that would make for some uncomfortable shifting in blame? At least the conclusion of the book does encourage parents to get acquainted with these tools… but still, this is left until rather late and fails to engage with the point when it presented itself.\n\nWhat’s next? Compare social media to tobacco? Lead paint? Yup.\n\nAt least he makes some solid claims about displacement activities and sleep deprivation having negative social consequences. These are clearly valid points, and I am broadly sympathetic to the general thesis, but the science of devices and blue-light circadian rhythms’ impact upon sleep are highly disputed when it comes to this line of argumentation (as pointed out by Pete Etchells in his book, Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time). Why not look at, say, diet and concentrations of sugar, caffeine and artificial sweeteners alongside this data? Why not consider how access to digital media has enabled young people to see through the shallow promises of neoliberal precariousness?\n\nNah, it must be the phones.\n\nAnd then, the book seriously detours. We have a significant section that is reliant upon Johann Hari’s \"Stolen Focus\" - a writer who is not without controversy with regard to integrity. That the same anecdote about a bored and displaced teen gets dragged up a few times to fill the narrative, when many readers will have serious doubts about Hari’s recollection of such an event given his past record, seems convenient but unconvincing. Remember, this is the same book that took until page 176 (!) to announce “We don’t have any long-term studies tracking changes in people’s ability to focus over time”, rendering much of the work a pure speculation. And this book is cited several times. Please refer to the section in Pete Etchell’s book about studies into attention for more nuance.\n\nAt least Haidt is circumspect about the impact of technology on boys in chapter 7. But that doesn’t stop him from blaming video games for social disconnection and rise in nihilistic beliefs, circa a cursory reference to Durkheim’s work, in an effort to explain why suicidal ideation is more impactful in girls over boys - with none of the methodological reflection that this work entailed (ie Durkheim's infamous ecological fallacy debate). Given Durkheim’s work on suicide data in Christian France pointed to the problem in keeping accurate records of self harm due to cultural norms regarding spiritual ascendancy (suicide is a sin; denied a Christian funeral, differences between Catholics and Protestants, etc), we should be alert to what seems like a cherry-picked approach to ideas that fit the author’s thesis while avoiding addressing some of the implications of such an approach. That oversight might be forgiven if the next chapter wasn’t dedicated to the importance of “spirituality”…\n\nWhat follows is a chapter that is more of a rumination on the decline in social bonds that, obviously, he blames upon technology. Somewhere, I suspect there’s a parallel chain of thought which also points to digital connectedness as the source of this real world fragmentation. It’s possible that what we once thought of as community norms only fit for the vocal in the demos and that a significantly silent proportion of the community didn’t agree with all the norms that supposedly bound us together, yet they went along with them because doing so provided societal benefits. Now, access to alternatives via digitally social connectedness means that similar beliefs can be found outside the geographical community, hence undermining the importance of traditional norms. It seems Haidt likes the argument against modernity though. For him, time and space have become disembodied from the real world, thus meaning dissipates. Structured rituals lose their meaning. I’ll remember that when I have to miss the big game because I have to work this weekend.\n\nAnd yet… do I think that too much screen media at too soon an age is potentially detrimental to young (and old!) people? I’d issue a hesitant 'yes' here. This book makes for alarmist rhetoric: after all Haidt has something to sell and the stance he takes here is probably part of that process. I’m sure he means well. I’m just not sure I think the evidence base he presents is a solid as he claims. Aaron Brown has done a fair job of calling these claims into question, having pointed out that of the 476 studies Haidt mentions in his book, two third of them were originally published before 2010, and only 22 of them have data on heavy social media use or mental health: none have both.\n\nI’d recommend people check that out via Reason's website:\n\nhttps://reason.com/video/2024/04/02/t...\n\nThere are other issues in the way his data is employed, as others like Ruben Arslan have pointed out re: the 2017 'brain drain' claim.\n\nOne thing that Haidt has claimed is that he will update his associated book site with responses to criticism and the errors in his data. At the time of writing, it has received only one correction update… [edit Sept 1t5th] now 2 following Ruben C Arslan's critique (although Haidt misspelled his name!) which either points to the confidence in the claims or that he's not taking many of the criticisms seriously. Hard to say. Anne Scheel has offered an explanatory account of why these erratum sites exist. Readers can draw their own conclusions.\nShow more",

        "Review 10": "12/5/24 addendum: The 2024 Goodreads Choice Award Winner for Best Nonfiction.\n\nIf you are a parent of a child between the ages of 0 and 18: please do yourself the favor of reading Jonathon Haidt’s book “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness”. It may save yourself much frustration, fear, and grief down the line.\n\nHaidt’s book is the inevitable endpoint of research and knowledge that started in 2010 with Nicholas Carr’s book “The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to To Our Brains” and followed, in 2022, by Johann Hari’s book “Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t pay Attention—-and How to Think Deeply Again”.\n\nHaidt’s book provides conclusive (or pretty damned near) evidence of what Carr could only hypothetically predict would happen 14 years later and substantiates, with further studies and statistics, what Hari was saying in his book.\n\nThe basic premise is this: Sometime around the years 2010 to 2015, something drastic and worrisome started happening to children born in the late-1990s (a demographic of children often referred to as “Gen Z”). Rates of childhood depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation began to skyrocket across the country. This was across racial, ethnic, and gender lines, although it seemed to effect girls more.\n\nHaidt and his researchers believe that a combination of factors are the reason for these high rates of mental illness among children.\n\nOne factor is a type of parenting called “helicopter parenting” that became prevalent, which essentially involves an extreme overprotection of children, out of an irrational sense of safety, that does not allow—-or over-regulates—-certain childish activities that children of the ‘70s and ‘80s engaged in quite regularly: climbing trees, walking unsupervised to the park or school or store, playing on a playground, skateboarding, staying in a house by him or herself.\n\nAnother factor is the prevalence of devices that allowed children a preponderance of “screen time” that far exceeded previous norms in previous generations. Haidt directly links this rise of device usage to the introduction of smartphones (specifically, iPhones, which were brought to market in 2007) and popular social media platforms like Facebook (launched in 2004).\n\nA third factor is an inexplicable “underprotection” of children from the Internet and, specifically, social media sites. So-called helicopter parents were fearful of their children playing on a jungle gym, but they seemed to have a complete lack of worry about their children being vulnerable to cyberbullying or on-line sexual predators. One explanation for this—-given by parents themselves in studies—-is the parents’ own distractedness and addiction to device usage.\n\nHaidt’s solutions—-based on the advice of mental health professionals, educators, and social scientists—-is weirdly simple: Don’t give your kid a smartphone until they are about 16-18; Limit kids in both time and access to the Internet; allow kids to do more activities unsupervised; increase the amount of playtime for kids.\n\nAccording to almost every scientific study, playtime has been shown to be vitally important to a child’s development. Despite this fact, many schools have limited or eliminated playtime and replaced it with more academics, such as testing, to detrimental results. Thankfully, there is a swing back towards more playtime during school hours, especially more unsupervised playtime.\n\nEven Haidt acknowledges that it goes against every fiber in one’s being to let your kid walk to the grocery store in town by him or herself. On the same token, it’s hard to give up the “babysitter” benefits of the iPad or iPhone.\n\nI’ll be honest: I get a shitload of laundry and house-cleaning done when my daughter is curled up on the couch playing God-knows-what on her iPad, and while I trust that my daughter is playing appropriate games and not browsing Youtube for porn, I realize that it’s not the healthiest thing for her.\n\nSeriously, Haidt’s book is an important resource for parents, teachers, and health care providers. We need to be more aggressive advocates for the health of our children, but if healthier children means loosening the reins and letting our kids engage in more risky activities by themselves while simultaneously limiting—-or forbidding—-access to stupid shit like Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook, then we need to do some serious soul-searching as parents.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "full video explaining a lot more of my thoughts: HERE\n\nThis is the book Jinger could not write - a full expose on the Duggar family dealings, how the parents use the family machine and religion to control their children, and the hard, hard work of therapy and coming to know yourself that it takes to leave.\n\nNow I say Counting the Cost is the book Jill - not Jinger - had to write. Because for a people pleaser, a favorite child, and the first to get married and to leave, Jill was the guinea pig for what it meant to be a Duggar Daughter.\n\nAs a former IBLP Daughter - I felt Jill's emotional, hard-wrought struggle. The day she wore pants for the first time, her father's ensuing meltdown, the tension of longing to please, yet desperate for freedom - that journey was achingly familiar.\n\nThe anxiety I felt the entire last third of this book - if you grew up with a controlling, manipulative parent - you too will understand. Because controlling parents are not just in fundamentalist cults. They exist across religious and cultural lines.\n\nAnd rarely, rarely, does anyone have the courage to explore family estrangement. Jill outlines the cost of estrangement - the cost to not set your boundaries and the cost once you do.\n\nAlso 100% true to experience to spend 200 pages outlining extreme parental abuse to end with the small steps you’re taking to reconcile with said parent.\nBecause completely cutting off a parent is next to impossible and the desire to one day please them is ever-present. Ugh, I see myself in Jill’s voice so much.\n\nBravo, Jill. Bravo to all the IBLP Daughters who have fought so long, and so hard, for our voice. The cost is beyond what anyone outside of IBLP could ever grasp. But the freedom - the joy - and the peace beyond IBLP is well worth every penny.\n\n\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "this woman just fully outed her father committing tax fraud",
        "Review 3": "This book is not some sort of juicy tell-all. It is not the Duggar version of Jennette McCurdy's book either, though they share themes of child abuse and exploitation by the media. Jill's memoir is a straightforward recounting of growing up in the IBLP cult, being exploited by the Duggar show and by her father, and the steps she's taken towards healing and independence.\n\nI disagree with the conservative views that, as far as I'm aware, Jill and her husband still hold. As an ex-Christian and a fundie snarker, I privately hoped to see more deconstruction of her upbringing and beliefs in this book, especially following the excellent Shiny Happy People documentary this summer. Jill is not critical of Michelle, despite how clear it seems to me that she has enabled and supported Jim Bob behind the scenes. All of that said, deconstruction and healing come in all forms, and I found myself so happy for Jill and the emotional work she's done. Before therapy even came up in the book, I noticed her word choice referring to her \"inner critic\" and responded like \"Yes! She's gotten therapy!\"\n\nThe work is no literary masterpiece, but it is still effective in its matter-of-fact tone at highlighting the systemic issues surrounding the Duggar family. There's an interesting intersection here between capitalist media, abusive family dynamics, and religious control. The combined balance of power seemed to weigh against Jill in every direction, and I'm proud of her for her self-advocacy. She does not go into detail about her experiences with Josh, and I respect that choice. That story was broadcast to so many people already, and her retraumatization has been so potent that I'm glad she has firmly decided not to talk about it. While I do think abuse needs to be talked about in order to be addressed, this should never be done without the consent of the victims and without giving them control over how the story is told.\n\nOverall, this memoir plays it very safe, and this is probably a wise tactical move on Jill's part, especially given that she does not want to burn bridges with her family. Reading this book, it seems impossible to cast her as disrespectful, rebellious, or uncaring, though other fundamentalists still somehow do so. It's disheartening that Jim Bob and Michelle's response seems to be disappointment in Jill for telling her story publicly rather than handling it privately, though we see in the book that it's easier for the Duggar patriarch to maintain control and perpetuate imbalances of power when these issues are kept private. Although Jill doesn't take her deconstruction as far as I'd like to see it go, this work communicates how deeply she does not want to cause pain to others, and that in itself is very moving.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "I was initially hesitant about reading Counting the Cost by Jill Duggar, especially since some of my family members had recently read a book by one of her sisters and highly recommended it. While my interest was piqued, I hadn’t gotten around to it. However, when I was searching for a book for a reading challenge, I realized this one fit my goals perfectly.\n\nWhat an experience listening to the audiobook was! Sample it here: Counting the Cost by Jill Duggar - (Audiobook)\n\nI went into the book half-expecting it to be a typical “tell-all” story—one where the author tears everyone down to vindicate themselves. But to my relief, that wasn’t the case at all. Yes, Jill does open up about some really difficult things from her childhood and early adult years, but even the people she may now have disagreements with are not spoken about with bitterness or malice.\n\nIf I had to sum up this book in a few words, I’d say it’s honest, heartfelt, and impactful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and deeply appreciated Jill’s willingness to share her personal experiences with readers like me who have only seen the glossy version of her family on TV. This memoir offers a glimpse into the story behind the show, and it was incredibly encouraging. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys memoirs, especially those about people stepping out in faith and recovering from strict religious upbringings.\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Jill's memoir did not disappoint. She tells the somewhat familiar story of her family but with the details that viewers never knew.\n\nThroughout the book, you get to witness the transformation of Jill from a submissive people pleasing girl to a strong independent woman.\n\nShe does not shy away from hard topics and addresses the complicated relationship with her parents. The book is very insightful, and it is definitely worth the read.\n\nJill, if you see this, I'm cheering you on! Your resilience and bravery inspire me. I really relate to your religious upbringing and the parental conflicts as an adult. I've been through something similar and I know how difficult it can be to find your own autonomy and voice. The truth will set you free, and you can hold your head up knowing that your conscience is clear.\n\nNote: I picked up this book at a bookstore over the weekend, not realizing my good fortune as it hasn't officially been released yet. I read it in one night!!\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "I read this is one sitting and if I could give zero stars I would....\n\nI'm usually not this harsh when it comes to memoirs, but my friends I have a bone to pick with Jill Duggar and her homophobic/transphobic husband. Now, I picked this up because I grew up watching the Duggar family and I was curious to see how much Jill has been able to deconstruct her fundamentalist upbringing. Survey says that little to no deconstruction has occurred.\n\nFirst, I applaud Jill for being able to use her voice. It takes a lot to be able to open up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of Jim Bob and her brother. To recount that and share it with the world must be difficult in a way that a lot of us don't understand. What was interesting about this read to me is that I found Derrick to be controlling as well. Not in the same capacity as Jim Bob, but still dominating in a way that is uncomfortable. It's also fascinating that not once in this book did she hold Michelle responsible for any behaviors she engaged in during their time on television and after. It is hard to deny the fact that Michelle enabled and allowed the behavior of her husband to continue in a way that was harmful to her children, yet Jill made her carry no burden of the responsibility. I'm not sure if that is because of the dynamics of their religious beliefs, but it was interesting.\n\nJill may be separating herself from the Duggar family, but she and her husband continue to be a reminder of why I take issue with White Evangelicalism. The way she talked about mission work gave this undertone that they \"must save the poor brown people who know nothing of our Jesus.\" It's disgusting. And while I can recognize the traumatic situations that Jill was raised in, I can equally acknowledge the irony of her and her husband seeking empathy while he goes on transphobic tirades via Twitter. This exploration of her time on television via her family is two-fold; it serves as a space for her to voice her feelings, but at the same time it's pretty surface level. No reader should dive into this expecting big revelations. If you've kept up with the family then you'll know most of the content of this book. I find it both disgusting and deplorable the way that Jim Bob treated Jill, but I also find Derrick's behavior disgusting. More therapy and more time are needed. It'll be interesting to see where these two end up in about 10-15 years.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "\"You want to know why I'm crying?\" My voice was cracked, my eyes burning. \"It's that you think I'm some kind of horrible person just because I wear pants and have a nose ring, and yet you see the girl outside and praise her. That's why I'm crying, Daddy. I'm evolving and changing, just like that girl out there, but you can't see it. You treat me like I'm a prodigal who's turned her back on you. You treat me worse than you treat my pedophile brother.\" pg. 268\n\n\nLike many others, I grew up watching the 19 Kids and Counting TV show on TLC, not because I am religious, or a part of the IBLP, but because I thought the family was so interesting. I watched live as Josh Duggar's involvement in the Ashley Madison scandal came out to the public, and when the information about his abuse toward his sisters came out, I watched the Jill and Jessa interview with Megyn Kelly. By then I knew the family was not healthy, and to some extent abusive but I continued watching as Jill and Jessa: Counting on was on TLC. Over the years it has become clear that Job-Bob was abusive and controlling to his children in many, many ways, however, the Shiny Happy People documentary that was released earlier this year really put the abuse into perspective for their wider audience and even the general public.\n\n\n\"I was blind to it at the time, but eventually, I would see just how dangerous and toxic IBLP's teachings about authority were in my life.\" pg. 74\n\n\nAlthough Jill's memoir covers similar topics that are discussed in the Shiny Happy People documentary, (which she was a part of) what I really enjoyed about this book was hearing it from her perspective, and in her words. You could tell through her writing how empowered she was to be finally telling her story, and I know this book will reach and inspire hundreds of people to find their voice and do the same. If not, it will be validating to people in similar situations of familial abuse and control, whether there are ties to religion or not, and without a doubt in my mind will help many leave similar situations.\n\n\n“It seemed to me that he was realizing that he was losing control of me. He’d text verses reminding me to “honor thy father and mother,” and every conversation we had just heaped more guilt on me, leaving fear gripping my throat even tighter. Often he would text me and apologize, but the messages were often followed up by more words condemning our actions or calling us out. His apologies felt insincere and invalid. Hardly a day would go by without some barbed message from him—either directly or from one of my siblings—and it got so that I didn’t want to talk to him anymore.\" pg. 210\n\n\nOverall, as a fan of Jill Duggar as a little girl, and as a big fan of her now as an adult, all I have to say is that I am so proud of her. The fact that she named the things Jim-Bob (and sometimes Michelle) were doing to her as abuse, and called her brother Josh a pedophile, are two of many clear signs in this book that she's been able to break out of the cult control of the IBLP, Bill Gothard's 7 basic life principles, the umbrella of authority, the abusive control of her parents, and deprogram and grow from all she's been through. It was also encouraging to read about how many of her siblings (whom she doesn't name, which I respect so much) now have come to her for advice on how to ensure Jim-Bob does not infiltrate, dictate, or influence their marriages, and how others have followed in her footsteps of wearing pants, drinking alcohol, using birth control, etc. She is such a huge role model, and if the rest of the kids see through her that freedom from the control their under is possible, hopefully, it will be easier for them if they decide to follow in her footsteps. I am so happy she was able to find a husband and partner as supportive as Derrick and wish nothing but peace and happiness for her, Derrick, and their 3 beautiful children.\n\nIf you are a former fan of the 19 Kids and Counting TV show, the Duggars in general, religious cults, or celebrity memoirs I highly recommend reading Counting the Cost by Jill Duggar. It was real, emotional, and extremely impactful. It is definitely one of my favourite celebrity memoirs I've ever read, and I wouldn't be surprised if it makes my top 10 books of 2023 list at the end of the year!\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "Let me start this by saying that I grew up in IBLP at the same time the Duggars did, so my training/experiences are similar.\n\nI admire the work that Jill has done in her own life to break free from IBLP teachings. As someone who is actively doing this work as well, I know first-hand how hard it is to deprogram from this thinking. To those reviewers who are saying that she does not go far enough, I would like to remind you that this is not your garden-variety evangelicalism that she's breaking from. This is a level of mind and body control that gets into your nervous system and that will take decades to break free from. Outsiders may see how much further she can go, but good grief, just cut her some slack.\n\nAlso, as Jill freely admits, she was trained to not criticize her family. I know from experience that this does not go away overnight. Ten-plus years into therapy and my heart still races when I say anything even remotely contradictory to my family. I commend her for how far she was able to go in this book in calling out the wrongs committed by her family – and her dad in particular.\n\nAs I was reading Jill's story, I couldn't help but think how responsible the fandom is for her family's toxic rise to fame – TLC, the regular watchers who tuned in for the spectacle, even the snarkers – all this contributes to the dollar amounts places like People and TLC were willing to pay for wedding photos and baby stories.\n\nA few other thoughts/ways that IBLP impacted me:\n- Performative behaviors that lead to loneliness.\n- Parents who pit siblings against one another.\n- Jinger calling her parents to justify her behavior after she became an adult (I've done this so many times).\n\nI've seen a few articles about this book saying (almost lamenting) that it is not a tell-all. I have no idea what these people want, because Jill is clearly laying bare the hypocrisy, abuse, and manipulation she endured. It doesn't have to be any more extreme than that for it to be bad.\n\nI have also seen a few people question why she does not hold her parents more responsible (something she addresses in the book), and to that I say, it's not your journey. Also keep in mind that her parents are both victims and perpetrators: they are victims of Bill Gothard's teachings and they actively harmed their children. Both can be true at the same time. Jill needs to deal with her own shit and she needs to let her parents deal with theirs – she is not responsible for their behavior. Jill is only responsible for her and she's doing that admirably.\n\nAs someone who grew up in IBLP, and who is now deprogramming, it is comforting to hear of other people who have had similar struggles to break free. It's good to know that not everyone who was brought up in that world has stayed. It gives me hope that in another generation, IBLP will be just a footnote in the history books. Thanks, Jill.\n\n-----\n\nEDIT: Even though my experience aren't as extreme as Jill's, if you're interested in what it's like to leave fundamentalism, I write about it at https://notyourhelpmeet.substack.com/\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Jill Duggar and her husband Derrick are still very problematic people in my personal view, but out of the 19 Duggar kids it's pretty clear that Jill is definitely one of the most normal people in her extended family. She has learned boundaries, she has gone to therapy, and she chose to stop participating in the family reality tv series before it got cancelled (again) due to her brother Josh's actions (again). This book, which Jill also narrates for the audiobook, is a good look behind the scenes of the Duggar façade that TLC and Jill's parents have put up. For those who have watched the show you will find out\n- how things really went when Jill visited Derrick in Nepal\n- the dangers they faced during their missionary trip in Guatemala\n- what finally forced Jill and Derrick to demand financial compensation for their time on the tv show - and how the fall out from that led to them emotionally and physically distancing themselves from some of her family\n\nI found this book to be very interesting seeing as a train-wreck watcher of the Duggar tv shows (as in, I couldn't look away even though I found the family and their beliefs to be disturbing).\n\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "Finished in one sitting. 5 stars because she is a Christ follower who does not shy away from being fully transparent about all of the harm her parents and siblings put her through. Jinger’s book gives a lot of insight on why the IBLP breeds men into abusive cult leader fathers, and this book gives the DETAILS of how that played out in the Duggar family. She has overcome sexual abuse, verbal abuse, and manipulation all in the name of Christianity, and yet she still has found the truth and is pursuing Christ.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "4.5 Stars. I was excited to read the Kindle edition of David Grann's The Wager. This is an astoundingly and painstakingly well-researched book of historical non-fiction. It is a story of the shipwrecked Wager, a tale of death, destruction, betrayal, and survival. Some of the events and names of characters involved were well-known in the 1700s but have been lost in history. David Grann has revived the incredible story with his meticulous research.\n\nI read the ebook on my Kindle and found it difficult to put down. I wanted to know who would survive in such a storm-swept place and what the outcome would be. The central characters were well-drawn, and many others were named Grann’s The Killers of the August Moon, and the Lost City of Z had fewer characters to sort out, and they read more like fiction, but this story was more complex and far-reaching.\n\nI had heard about press gangs who grabbed men off the streets, forcing them to work on the ships. These were often criminal elements and the scum of society. The author draws an incredible picture of invalid and injured veterans hauled out of hospital, some carried on stretchers onto the ships to perform naval duties.\n\nI had not known that upper-class boys as young as 14 could join the Navy with the ambition of becoming future officers and gentlemen. John Byron is featured as an example. He attended a private school and was expected to be able to draw, fence, dance, know classics and mathematics and some Latin while learning about tasks onboard the ship. He is forgotten today despite a successful naval career, but he was the grandfather of the poet Lord Byron.\n\nThe book is lavishly illustrated with excellent, helpful maps and 28 other well-chosen pictures. There are portraits of several of the main characters painted during their lifetimes, paintings of the Wager, etchings of the survivor's life on a desolate, remote island, photos of this place in the present and from 1742, pictures on how to amputate legs and arms. If you are reading an ebook, I recommend you switch to an iPad to enlarge the illustrations and view them in colour.\n\nA squadron of ships, including the Wager, was launched in 1740 by Britain to establish British domination over Spain and control the sea and trade routes with the aim of empire building. A secret mission was the capture of Spanish gold and silver. Conditions onboard the outbound ships were horrific. They were filthy, with sickening odours, vermin and insect-infested and hunger. There were many deaths from scurvy, tetanus, and infections. Healthy food and sufficient water were lacking. Excessive numbers of the crew were too sick to work. After the shipwreck, it is no wonder that hopes of survival were grim. Those who remained alive descended into savagery, treachery, theft, anarchy, mutiny, murder, and even cannibalism.\n\nTwo hundred eighty-three days after the Wager was believed to have sunk in a raging storm off Patagonia with all aboard lost at sea, a small, roughly constructed boat made it over 3,000 miles to Brazil. It had started the journey with 81 men, but now only 30 sick, skeletonlike men were barely alive. Six months later, a smaller boat washed up in Chile with only three men, who were emaciated, covered with bugs, delirious, and near death. Members of both groups feared returning to England because they thought there could be sufficient charges to warrant death by hanging following an Admiralty trial. The newcomers blamed the first group of mutiny and abandoning crew members on shore to die from thirst, cold weather and starvation. There were countercharges of murder and treachery. The author describes the trial and leaves it to the reader to draw their own conclusions.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "“They had been shipwrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. Most of the officers and crew had perished, but eighty-one survivors had set out in a makeshift boat lashed together partly from the wreckage of the Wager. Packed so tightly onboard that they could barely move, they traveled through menacing gales and tidal waves, through ice storms and earthquakes. More than fifty men died during the arduous journey, and by the time the few remnants reached Brazil three and a half months later, they had traversed nearly three thousand miles – one of the longest castaway voyages ever recorded. They were hailed for their ingenuity and bravery. As the leader of the party noted, it was hard to believe that ‘human nature could possibly support the miseries that we have endured.’ Six months later, another boat washed ashore…”\n- David Grann, The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder\n\nDavid Grann’s The Wager is an entertaining entry in the robust subgenre of shipwreck literature. The boat in question – the titular HMS Wager – sported twenty-four guns and a crew of around 120 sailors and marines. In 1741, during the War of Jenkin’s Ear, it was part of a squadron led by Commodore George Anson, which was looking to make trouble for the Spanish on the Pacific coast of South America.\n\nUnfortunately, due to poor seamanship – compounded by a crew laid low by scurvy – the Wager ran aground near the Patagonian coast, after getting separated from the rest of the squadron by bad weather.\n\nThe men made it to shore, where they built shelter and tried to rescue supplies from the ship. Despite their efforts, the famed discipline of the Royal Navy broke down. It did not take long before the situation made The Lord of the Flies look like a pleasant day at Sandals Jamaica.\n\nFactions formed. A separate encampment sprung up. Food was pilfered. Orders were disobeyed. Some men did a lot of work; others did none at all. Captain David Cheap shot a man in the face without warning.\n\nRunning low on food, part of the crew mutinied, and set out in a boat, leaving the captain and two midshipmen behind, setting up parallel survival stories that would eventually – against all odds – intersect again.\n\nThe bare outlines above clearly show the vast potential of this material. It has the makings of a great story, and needs only a competent storyteller.\n\nThankfully, Grann is exactly that.\n\n***\n\nIn his prior book – Killers of the Flower Moon – Grann was able to deliver a solid murder mystery that also doubled as a larger critique of the treatment the United States government meted out to the Osage tribe.\n\nHere, Grann clearly wants to do the same thing. To that end, he makes a couple not-entirely-convincing attempts to place the Wager’s ill-starred voyage into a larger context of imperialism. For the most part, though, he recognizes that – to use an infamous tautology – the tale contained in The Wager is what it is: a disaster at sea, no more, no less. It is not a world-historical event; it is not representative of anything. There is no deeper meaning to be derived, other than what can be learned about human nature under duress.\n\nLeaving aside these halfhearted pretensions, The Wager is sturdily, pleasingly old-fashioned in its scope and execution. Grann starts with a prologue that essentially outlines what is to come, and then lets things unfold chronologically over five separate sections, that neatly divide the action. Just over 250 pages of text, this is a quick, efficient book that never lingers too long or strays too far.\n\n***\n\nAs he has shown in the past, Grann has a good nose for underappreciated historical events. More than that, he understands that a nonfiction story is only as good as the available documentation. To bring the past to life, you need evidence, and that is not always present.\n\nThankfully, Grann not only chose to write about a relatively unknown disaster, but one in which the participants wrote a bunch of stuff down. This is important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it allows Grann to create memorable characterizations, especially the aforementioned Captain Cheap and his erratic decision-making; Gunner John Bulkley, the leader of the mutineers, who proved both a marvelous sailor and a solid literary craftsman; and Midshipman John Byron, the eventual grandfather of Lord Byron, who at the time was just starting a long, rather fruitful naval career.\n\nSecond, Grann is able to present a visceral sense of place, whether that is the canting deck of a warship, a distant, seemingly-uninhabited island, or an open boat on the vastness of the ocean.\n\n***\n\nEven a well-documented eighteenth century shipwreck necessarily suffers from some evidentiary gaps. This difficulty is heightened by the fact that two competing groups of men gave two extremely conflicting versions of what happened. For example, both Bulkley, who faced hanging as a mutineer, and Captain Cheap, who faced the end of his career, had ample incentive to place themselves in the best possible light. Grann is at his most masterful when presenting and weighing contradictory accounts while maintaining a seamless narrative.\n\nGrann is also very judicious in his use of filler. While the central storyline is inherently fascinating, he adds to it with valuable side discussions on life in the Royal Navy, the effects of scurvy, and the indigenous people that the castaways met, and then thoroughly alienated. His digressions are so good that I didn’t even mind that The Wager kept going even after it reached its natural conclusion, since it involved a well-described naval battle in which Commodore Anson captured a Spanish treasure ship laden with pieces-of-eight.\n\n***\n\nGood stories are their own justification. Nevertheless, it seems to me that Grann wanted The Wager to say something big. Ultimately, though, it has to settle for saying something specific: that humans are complicated. Some are mostly good, some are mostly bad, but most are a combination of each, and it can be hard to know a person for certain until your ship has sunk, the food has run out, and thousands of miles of tumultuous seas stand between you and home.\nShow more",

        "Review 4": "David Grann has done an amazing job with the true story, The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder, which describes the 1741 journey of The Wager, a British warship. Over the following two years, it is an incredulous journey of survival, betrayal, mutiny, and murder.\n\nI listened to it on audiobook and Dion Graham does an AMAZING job as narrator. I felt like I was right in the midst of the action. There are frequent references to the orlop deck, the lowest deck in a ship which is below the water line. My last name is Orlopp. Many seafaring stories, including the Titanic, mention the orlop deck.\n\nThe book references phrases that actually began with sailors. \"Three sheets to the wind\" refers to three cloth sails on a boat bobbing drunkenly on the sea. \"Turn a blind eye\" refers to the time a sailor put a telescope up to his blind eye.\n\nThis book is storytelling at its best!

        "Review 5": "\"The Wager\" by David Grann is an enthralling masterpiece that transported me to the treacherous world of shipwrecks, mutiny, and murder. The link to the audiobook can be found here The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder . Grann's eloquent prose painted vivid imagery, allowing me to immerse myself in the harrowing journey of the characters.\n\nThe book is a testament to Grann's impeccable research and attention to detail. His ability to unearth historical records and piece together a gripping narrative is truly remarkable. I found myself captivated by the authenticity and depth of the story, as well as the insights into the challenges faced by the sailors.\n\nOne of the aspects that I appreciated most about the book was the seamless blend of suspense and historical context. Grann expertly balanced the tension and intrigue, while also providing a rich backdrop of maritime history. It was a delightful combination that kept me fully engaged and hungry for more.\n\nAlthough there were moments when the pacing felt slightly uneven, it did not detract from the overall enjoyment I derived from the book. Grann's ability to transport me to another time and place, immersing me in the perils and triumphs of the characters, more than made up for any minor pacing issues.\n\n\"The Wager\" is a gripping and thought-provoking read that left a lasting impression on me. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and the resilience of the human spirit.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "It is often said that real events are more fascinating than fiction, and the story of The Wager, an English ship which set off in pursuit of the Spanish 'prize of all oceans' in the early 1740s proves such a statement perfectly. Left in obscurity, the story of the Wager was unearthed by Mr Grann who wrote an unputdownable book about the courage, loyalties and mutiny. I followed the maps while listening to the audiobook and it added to the thrill. One of the main historic figures is Lord Byron's grand-father, who was barely a teenager while boarding The Wager and whose grandson referred to his ancestor's marine voyages and achievements. Incredible story! Now I am ready to relisten to it and already have it on hold again.\nOverDrive, thank you!\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "I'm gonna make this quick and easy: This is a wonderful, can't-put-it-down book. The GR description captures the broad outlines so I needn't bother with that. Just prepare to be completely swept away (sorry, couldn't help myself) by a true story about: 18th century naval battles, terrible storms with deadly waves and winds, shipwrecks, mutiny, murder, betrayals, disease, kidnapping, cannibalism, indigenous people who travel and hunt in canoes (!) in one of the most treacherous ocean passages in the world, and more. A lot more! Grann is a great storyteller. He's got a fantastic gift for timing and description, and the story of HMS Wager gives him an arena to put his gifts to glorious use. You read this and begin to get a true sense of daily life on a ship, how arduous it was, how crowded and dangerous it all was. You wonder, how did anyone survive these voyages? And then go back to sea? The men -- and boys -- could be gone for years at a time. All the details I read with minimal understanding in the novels of Patrick O'Brian now make sense. And no, you don't need to be familiar with O'Brian or like his books at all. Just think of the movie \"Master and Commander\" (I know, based on an O'Brian novel but you might have liked the film but not the book), Endurance, Robinson Crusoe, and Mutiny on the Bounty.\n\nA great story of true adventure and history, of survival against the worst of odds, of human behavior under extreme duress... In short, I loved it.\n\nMy thanks to Doubleday Books and Edelweis+ for providing an advance digital copy in return for an honest review.)\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "The Wager is one of the most fascinating true stories you could ever wish to read. This ship was purchased from the East India Company in 1739 by the Royal Navy. In 1741 it formed part of a fleet charged with the mission to sale around the Southern tip of South America (YIKES!!!!) and hang out in the Pacific Ocean to menace the Spanish fleets of the day.\n\nThe fleet consisted of six warships (of which Wager was one of the small ones) and two transport vessels. Before leaving Portsmouth, the Navy were required to recruit enough people to make up 120 odd crew. This was a feat in itself, it proved so difficult (with people deserting) they had to employ disabled and injured crew from other ships just returned from previous voyages. Many were stretchered on board no less! Anyway, the Captain of Wager, died before reaching Cape Horn and Lieutenant David Cheap, a young, stern, keen officer, was appointed as acting captain. Captain Cheap was later to become a much maligned (perhaps unfairly) historical figure – all due to the events that were about to unfold.\n\n\n\n\nOMG!!!\n\nUpon passing through Cape Horn – which is known for the strongest of winds, massive waves, currents, and icebergs disaster struck. Wager had not travelled sufficiently far enough West before turning North (Captain Cheap was often blamed by his crew) and she struck ground within a group of remote and desolated island at the Western tip of Southern Chile and was shipwrecked.\n\nBefore the shipwreck of Wager, the sets this up beautifully by introducing us to the main players and detailing what life on a ship of that time was like. The politics, discipline, working the sails, duties, the food, the duties of the surgeon, all the dangers involved, the dreaded scurvy (oh dear!!) and lots more. By the time Wager reached the tip of South America, the crew were in no fit state to operate this ship – largely due to scurvy. The descriptions of the sufferers was horrible, even for someone who’s spent his life working with faeces, sputum, urine, and pus – I found it a bit much.\n\nOnce shipwrecked – there were instances of looting, fighting and conflict among groups, murder, mutiny even cannibalism was considered – imagine staring at your workmates with this in mind. The group split into groups, they tried to live off this barren land, and in effect they became walking skeletons, most died. I cannot describe that happens after the crew split into groups and decided on various courses of action to go home. You’ll have to read this to find out.\n\nIt is brilliantly written, it is the ultimate ripping yarn.\n\nThere is a lot to learn here, but at no stage did this book become an effort. It passed through me with ease. Highly recommended, you will not believe what happens.\n\n5 Stars\n\nNewsflash: I believe there's a movie either in production, or currently being made re theWager, starring Leo DiCaprio (as Cheap??) and directed by Martin Scorsese. Now wouldn't that be a treat?\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "The Wager is a capable if underwhelming narrative history, further let down by some clumsy and out-of-place editorialising. It's a shame because, over the years, David Grann has been one of my favourite non-fiction writers; his The Lost City of Z was well-researched and had the pace of a good novel, and his essay collection The Devil and Sherlock Holmes found some truly weird and fascinating topics to cover, such as the Polish writer whose crime novel sounded suspiciously similar to an unsolved murder from a few years previously.\n\nHowever, I have also experienced some disquiet off the back of more recent releases. The White Darkness was too slim to be worth its price; an interesting essay padded out with photographs and white space to give it the RRP of a full book. Furthermore, it was too non-critical of its topic. The Old Man and the Gun was a naked cash-grab, pulling a few essays from the earlier The Devil and Sherlock Holmes and slapping a new title on it. Killers of the Flower Moon, Grann's best-known book (and soon to be a Scorsese film), had a thrilling true story behind it – Indians on a reservation strike oil and become wealthy beyond their dreams, before being bumped off by grasping white 'saviours' – but was less taut in its narrative than I expected from the writer of The Lost City of Z. It also allowed Grann a few whispers of the sort of ahistorical sanctimony that has sadly become all too common in mainstream releases.\n\nIt is the latter quirk which stands out most clumsily in The Wager, Grann's newest release which tells the true story of an 18th-century sea voyage and storm-stayed shipwreck which sees its marooned castaways devolve into mutiny before a desperate escape. I know it has become a bit cringeworthy nowadays to criticise a book for being 'woke', and is something I try to avoid when possible. Such politically-correct affectations from a writer – usually privileged, humourless, upper-middle-class types who don't know how easy they have it – draw a sigh from me and perhaps a shake of the head, rather than cause me to froth at the mouth and declaim the collapse of civilisation, as seems to be the case among many perpetually-online types. That said, when Grann takes his story – a true story of human endurance and endeavour, of unimaginable hardship and desperation and terror, as well as feats of ingenuity and navigational skill – and warps it into an ungracious, moralising critique of imperialism, it compels me to put my boots on, and remark upon it at length.\n\nPearls are clutched when contemporary sources refer to indigenous people as 'savages' (pg. 123), as this betrays \"their inherent racism\" (pg. 223), and the idea that the British saw themselves as bringing civilisation to such noble, resourceful cultures – look, Grann says, they can build canoes and know where to find food! – is \"condescending\" (pg. 126). The slave trade is shoehorned in, despite the story of the ill-fated HMS Wager having nothing to do with it. Grann's raison d'être for his book is that the HMS Wager's voyage was evidence of imperial hubris and deservedly got its comeuppance; that the castaways' discipline unravelled over many months of unspeakable hardship shows that the purported superiority of their Empire was hollow; that some of the starved men were so desperate they resorted to cannibalism proves it was they who were the real 'savages' (pg. 242).\n\nIt's astonishingly tactless and mean-spirited to use this true story of human misery and endurance to make such a distasteful political point – imperialism being a paper tiger in 2023 – and particularly on such thin evidence. The descent into uncivilised chaos is, despite Grann's editorialising, shown to be rather tame given the circumstances; among the 100+ who survive the shipwreck, only a few resort to cannibalism (and evidence of this is even thinner). The mutineers even draft up legal documents to document and legitimise each of their (often very rational) decisions! The starved, shipwrecked men make their return trip through some of the most challenging waters in the world in less time than Magellan did (pg. 194), after months of woe and without much in the way of navigational aid, in a makeshift boat salvaged from scraps – but Grann is not impressed. For him, they committed the sin of not reflecting upon the fact they were \"the agents of an imperialist system. They were consumed with their own daily struggles and ambitions… But it is precisely such unthinking complicity that allows empires to endure… a system many of them rarely question\" (pg. 248).\n\nThis is a disgraceful passage of writing. It would be ahistorical in any book – to criticise the unfortunate castaways for imperialism is to criticise them for being born in the 18th century, rather than having the decency and foresight to be born into Grann's New York social circle in 2023 – but to condemn survivors in this way, after chronicling their hardships and mischance… to what purpose? It is as absurd as to write a book on the survivors of a plane crash, and condemn them for contributing to climate change. Grann ends the book by writing in his Acknowledgments page that \"writing a book can sometimes feel like navigating a ship on a long, stormy voyage\" (pg. 261). After maligning the feats and hardships of the Wager's castaways for his shallow point-scoring, such tone-deaf lack of grace at the end is astounding. It seems to me that the self-satisfied system to which Grann commits himself with such 'unthinking complicity' often has less to recommend it than the one the men of the Wager struggled under.\n\nHowever, while the above is the book's most offensive flaw, it is not its most fatal. However distasteful it is when presented, Grann's heroic and timely fight against racism in 1741 does not dominate the book on a page-by-page basis. Rather, it is that the flaws in previous Grann books, that I alluded to in the second paragraph of my review, all find further evidence in The Wager. The loosening of Grann's narrative skill, already in evidence in Killers of the Flower Moon, becomes completely slack in The Wager. The book moves lubberly from point to point, and while it has its achievements – Grann does well to explain the perils and circumstances of the sea to readers who may not understand them, and draws well the dispositions of the various castaway factions – it's a far cry from the zip of The Lost City of Z.\n\nAnd while the padding isn't as brazen as in The White Darkness, it's clear there's much of the story that Grann does not know about. And I don't mean his wrongheadedness on making racism the central crime, but the general structure on which we, the reader, are sold. The story purports to reveal the mystery of which of the competing factions of shipwrecked men were telling the truth – for those found to be in the wrong at court-martial will surely hang – but this is an anti-climax. The trial is no such thing; the mysteries mostly over pinning down who said what and when and why, which is a pretty mundane historical enterprise. Grann lamely says that it is \"impossible to know for sure what transpired behind the scenes\" (pg. 241), but nor does he make any attempt to find out. Any authorial speculation is of the unresearched, \"it's because they were imperialist racists\" variety. All the mystery is sifted out in Grann's telling of the story – a telling which becomes just a routine sea tale, told better elsewhere and with less editorialising.\n\nIt's a great shame, because although the story of the HMS Wager is not the fascinating mystery that Grann and his marketers have claimed, there were interesting angles that the author, had he the inclination to recognise them, could have found. One of the most interesting perspectives in the book comes when a young blue-blooded castaway, Byron (whose grandson would find fame as the poet Lord Byron), sneaks away from the mass of castaways who, under the command of a common gunner, Bulkeley, have decided to make that Magellan-like escape on their makeshift boat. Byron returns to the marooned, deposed captain on the barren, shelterless island, and Bulkeley, in his journal, comments that \"the Honourable Mr. Byron could not quite accommodate himself to 'lie forward with the men'\" in their cramped boat (pg. 176).\n\nWhile also not being the full story, this angle of class and hierarchy would have been much more appropriate to the story of The Wager, though naturally less appealing to the American Grann and his modern audience. All the talk of the slave trade and colonialism could instead have gone to discussion of the press-gang, a form of forced servitude which shows that Grann's white racist imperialists were hardly unthinking and complicit in the system that Grann, in his beatitude, is unwilling to forgive them for. Towards the end of the book, Grann again admonishes how these \"people tailor their stories to serve their interests – revising, erasing, embroidering – [as] do nations\" (pg. 251). For Grann to recognise this and yet contribute his own self-serving, editorialised version is a poor show.\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "A mediocre memoir of neurodivergence, turned into a major book deal due to the author’s claim to be a sociopath. Having read the book—often sensationalized both in its scenes and its larger claims—I doubt it. My money says she’s autistic, though I believe she believes she’s a sociopath, and this book is a fascinating unintentional examination of the power of labels. That said, despite that “Ph.D.” on the cover (and there are valid questions about Gagne’s credentials, seemingly boiling down to the fact that she attended an unaccredited school and no one can find any of her scholarship), don’t expect any science in this book. As perhaps should be expected from an author who embraces a non-scientific term as her identity.\n\nGagne’s primary symptom, according to her, is that from childhood she’s rarely felt much, and feels distant from her emotions even when she has them. Though she never uses the world, the term for this is alexithymia, and while it occurs in numerous contexts, it’s particularly common with autism. Gagne appears unaware of this. Certainly, when she was growing up (she’s probably in her 40s) there was little awareness of autism in girls, and her parents had none. She seems like a classic case, though: she describes a desire for solitude, invisibility and avoidance of small talk; not understanding social rules unless they were explained to her, and not always buying into rules if no one would be harmed in the breach; not knowing how to interact with others and having to learn it the hard way in her late teens, by consciously observing social interactions and imitating others’ body language (she calls this her “superficial charm,” but other neurodivergent people would just call it “masking”); and seeming strange to other kids for reasons she didn’t understand.\n\nAt any rate, her feeling out-of-place and her mother’s increasing disapproval of her failure to express expected emotions and abide by social rules makes her anxious. Gagne manages her anxiety and gets herself to feel something through thrill-seeking, and her chosen thrill is breaking rules (the other reason she thinks she’s a sociopath). One wonders how different her life might have been had she been introduced to, say, extreme sports, but she settles on clandestine trespassing. She loves sneaking into places she’s not supposed to be, and the solitude and feeling of invisibility this gives her. This can definitely be creepy—she breaks into other people’s houses when they’re gone just to hang out there—but she has a preference for abandoned buildings or houses that are empty while awaiting sale (her mother is a realtor, which makes it easy). She also likes to secretly follow people and stare through their windows at night, and in college she makes a sport of charming drunk frat boys out of their car keys and joyriding in their cars (she fills them up and returns them afterwards). So… maladjusted, definitely a violation of modern American social rules, but not quite the height of criminality.\n\nAnd that’s pretty much the extent of Gagne’s so-called sociopathic behavior. She claims to have “violent and destructive tendencies,” but this appears to consist entirely of: 1) one time when she was a young child and stabbed a bully with a pencil, and felt great about it, 2) another time when she was a kid and feeling lousy, she squeezed a cat too hard, then let it go, 3) one time in middle school when she locked some other kids in the school bathroom to see what would happen and 4) as an adult, she almost jumped a woman who had just threatened her sister. I’m failing to see the deeply abnormal relationship to violence here.\n\nMeanwhile, despite her claims to not care about people, Gagne… pretty clearly does. She’s closely attached to her mother as a child, dependent on her to explain social rules, and enjoys the bonding experience of confessing wrongdoing to her. (Unfortunately Gagne doesn’t realize that this won’t continue to get a loving response when it keeps happening, and she’s deeply hurt by her mother’s conclusion that she is bad and wrong. The mother’s response definitely leaves something to be desired, culminating in the moment where she excludes Gagne from burying her own pet because Gagne isn’t displaying the expected grief.) She loves and admires her younger sister, and notes that she was never jealous because she didn’t want the spotlight. She has a fairy-tale romance with her husband beginning at age 14, when she apparently immediately knew that he was the one. She reports disappointment at not feeling a rush of love for her own children at their birth, but then not everyone does, and it’s no surprise that she does come to love them, given that even when nannying other people’s she describes “intense feelings for those kids and [an] instinct to protect them at all costs.”\n\nAlso, as far as conscience, Gagne clearly doesn’t intuit or have much regard for social rules like private property, but she also does seem to have a moral compass. She thinks it’s important not to hurt anyone even if breaking the law. As a kid, she’s bothered by a neighbor kid who wants to harass her immigrant nanny and upset to see a teacher picking on a minority student. As an adult, she made me bust out laughing by gatekeeping sociopathy even as she reams out a woman (also a self-proclaimed sociopath) for covering up the woman’s dog killing a neighbor’s dog. Gagne feels she should be open about her “personality type” to friends and family, leading those with less compunction to ask her to engage in unethical behavior on their behalf because “you’re a sociopath, you don’t care,” which clearly makes her uncomfortable. Her self-diagnosis seems to work against her, though, because having founded her identity on being a sociopath who doesn’t care, she struggles to work out why she’s uncomfortable. Again, I can’t help thinking that many of her choices result from her leaning in to her own belief in her incorrigible badness: she actually portrays “the sociopath list” as a voiceover playing in her head as she goes through life.\n\nAs for the diagnosis itself, Gagne picked up the word young from a prison guard uncle, to describe people who commit crimes and don’t care, and having been convinced that these were her primary traits, seems to have clung to it ever since. When she’s in her 20s her father finally makes her go to a therapist, but Gagne seems to have just demanded a “sociopath test” from the therapist without considering any alternatives. I definitely wondered at the competence of the therapist, who goes along with it despite explicitly noting Gagne’s many differences from the definition. Both Gagne and the therapist seem to interpret the discrepancies as “sociopaths aren’t necessarily what we’ve been told” rather than “maybe you aren’t a sociopath.”\n\nAll of which leads us to: what even is a sociopath? Is it even a useful term, or just a media trope? The term is not in the DSM-V, which, okay—if Gagne had provided a reasoned critique of the DSM, I’d be here for it. Our understanding of mental health issues remains in very early stages, diagnosing symptoms as illnesses, guessing wildly at treatments, and generally failing to distinguish between actual pathology, different ways of being that are simply inconvenient for modern society, and adaptive responses to adverse events. Gagne doesn’t offer a critique though: she just identifies with the term “sociopath” and its descriptions far more than the DSM’s “antisocial personality disorder.” She also picks and chooses from definitions of sociopathy: she prefers it to psychopathy because it’s described as more malleable and treatable (on the theory that psychopaths are born while sociopaths are made, so could be unmade?), but fails to identify any environmental source for her own traits. (The only experience she describes as at all traumatic is other people’s reaction to her neurodivergence, which logically can’t have caused the neurodivergence. Though it probably did cause a lot of her behavior.) Also, those same sources seem to indicate that while you can have a well-adjusted psychopath, sociopaths are necessarily reckless and violent—otherwise they wouldn’t qualify for the definition. Gagne, though, just defines “sociopath” as whatever she is. At another point, she suggests it’s essentially “psychopath lite,” which feels right to her as a description of what she is but which does not appear to be used by anyone else.\n\nAll that aside, the book is readable, but sensationalized. The TV-movie comparisons are accurate. It’s full of “reconstructed” scenes and dialogue dating back to Gagne’s early childhood, and the writing itself is bland. Overall, fine for a quick read if you’re willing to read between the lines, and I agree with Gagne about the need to stop stigmatizing neurodivergence, but I don’t think this book has much to do with or to say about sociopathy. Skippable.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "This is a tricky one. For those with a strong educational foundation in mental health, psychology, or social work, the more clinical and academic information throughout this book felt very elementary. I found it very challenging to listen to Gagne’s narcissism, the way she announces herself as a sociopath on nearly every other page, and the way that so much of the events detailed throughout the memoir come across almost trivial. Gagne’s borderline obsession with finding some kind of meaning and identity in her sociopathy was extremely draining to listen to, so much so that I think this book could have benefited from a decent edit to weed out the repetition. There’s a lot of contradictory information throughout that I’m not entirely sure what to make of. This is definitely a fascinating read that I do believe could be a great step forward in deconstructing the ways in which society demonizes and vastly misunderstands sociopathy but would recommend erring on the side of caution when believing everything that Gagne has included in this memoir.\n\nReview Update: The more I have come to learn about this book and this author since reading the memoir, I would never recommend this book to anyone unless you are looking for something to easily entertain you. Much like watching a true crime Netflix documentary - mostly overexaggerated, unreliable and full of crap.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "THIS is why I love memoirs!! Being able to learn about something new, through the eyes and voice of someone who is living it. This is about Patric and her everyday life being a sociopath. Fascinating, especially as someone who loves all things psychology",
        "Review 4": "I don't believe a word this woman wrote. I was automatically suspicious of her, so I looked her academic credentials up. She has her MA and PhD from a school called the California Graduate Institute, which is essentially a diploma mill. Whether she is a sociopath or not is moot, she is a fraud.",
        "Review 5": "'Your friends would probably describe me as nice. But guess what? I can't stand your friends.\n\nI'm a liar. I'm a thief. I'm highly manipulative. I don't care what other people think. I'm capable of almost anything.'\n\nIn Sociopath: A Memoir, author Patric Gagne offers readers an unflinchingly honest and deeply personal account of her own experiences living with sociopathy. This compelling memoir provides a rare glimpse into the mind of someone grappling with a condition often shrouded in stigma and misunderstanding.\n\nGagne's narrative is both raw and introspective, as she candidly reflects on the challenges and complexities of navigating relationships, societal norms, and her own sense of morality. Through vivid anecdotes and poignant reflections, she invites readers to accompany her on her journey of self-discovery and acceptance.\n\nWhile Gagne's story is undeniably compelling, it is her courage and vulnerability as a writer that truly resonate. \"Sociopath: A Memoir\" is a testament to the power of storytelling as a means of self-exploration and understanding, and it is sure to leave a lasting impression on readers long after they turn the final page.\n\nFor anyone interested in psychology, memoirs, or simply the human experience, \"Sociopath: A Memoir\" is an essential read. Gagne's gripping narrative challenges us to confront our own assumptions about mental illness and offers hope for greater empathy and understanding in our society.\n\nI highly Recommend.\n\nThank you Macmillan Australia for gifting me an advanced copy of Sociopath for review.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "Buckle up, reader. This review is going to be a roller-coaster.\n\nIronically, Patric Gagne's Sociopath left me feeling a lot of different things. Gagne has written a memoir of her life as a sociopath. She chronicles how she tried to live a mostly non-violent life while trying to fight urges and pressures as she becomes more and more aware just how different she feels from everyone else. There is crime, love, and music. Gagne's memoir is not meant to tell a story, necessarily. It is more of a plea for society to stop looking at sociopaths and thinking, \"well, they will probably murder me if they had the chance.\"\n\nNormally, I start with the good of the book but here I need to start with the bad. One disclaimer: Gagne states in a note at the beginning of the book that she had to change names, timelines, and reconstruct dialogue. What I am about to say is not in any way me questioning her integrity. However, these reconstructed conversations stretch the bounds of believability. Gagne's scenes remind me of a TV show with very good writers who consistently put the perfect words into their character's mouth. It often feels that Gagne applies what she has learned as an adult to her past self. Also, we jump from perfectly timed scene to perfectly timed scene. An episode at the end of the book felt like she was setting up the finale of a movie. I think it's important to repeat that I don't question whether approximations of what we read actually happened. My issue is that Gagne has shined the story so bright that you almost want to look away. Gagne wants the reader to understand her plight and to also see that sociopaths deserve empathy even if they can't provide that themselves. Some of her points are good, but she also has other ideas which show both a lack of accountability for herself and possibly a savior complex.\n\nBut.....\n\nThen I kept thinking about what I was reading. It dawned on me that maybe I was holding Gagne to a higher standard than other memoirs I have read. Did I apply my suspicious eye to them or am I more suspect of Gagne because she is a sociopath? After all, don't many people think sociopaths will lie when it suits them? Would I say a cancer patient who simultaneously studies cancer cures has a savior complex? Is any of that the point?\n\nUltimately, no, the answers to those questions are not the point. The point was that I asked those questions. The book bounced around in my head and made me question my own views and to try and put myself in the shoes of a sociopath (as I am not one, I promise I've been checked).\n\nThis is not a perfect book. It has flaws. However, it convincingly accomplishes its goal. That is no small thing.\n\n(This book was provided as an advance copy by Netgalley and Simon & Schuster.)\nShow more",

Not sure how it serves that community either.

Randomly inserting cruel things she’s said just in the last few years, which do nothing but show she’s probably not a great person to be friends with? Idk it literally read like a grown woman writing a Mean Girls book in her 40s.\n\nIf you picked this up expecting citations, studies, even an iota of evidence based science go ahead and turn around.\n\nSo many of these elaborately embellished stories from her life -which it’s your memoir go for it- are just how people in her life were trying to love her just as she was then her turning around and blaming her shitty behavior on being a “sociopath”. Which fine but then she defends her shitty behavior not on her condition but turns it around on these people taking advantage of her?\n\nHer dubious medical credentials aside (which is a whole can of worms)-I do hope this community has a support system, I just don’t think I would start here.\n\n🎧: side note for audiobook listeners.

        "Review 8": "Patric Gagne holds a PhD in Clinical Psychology and was diagnosed with a mild form of antisocial personality disorder - and there are quite a few valuable things she aims to do here: She encourages readers to understand sociopathy as a form of emotional learning disability, meaning that some emotions do not come naturally to neurodivergent people afflicted with it. She also distinguishes deficits in emotional literacy from concrete behaviors, because behaviors entail decisions - and that's a valuable distinction when it comes to determining agency. And of course, Gagne shares personal experiences: In a twisty turn, she tells us what it feels like to be emotionally deprived, how it affected her as a child, a student, a wife, a mother.\n\nBut the problem is that this memoir is way too much in love with the assumed shock factor of declaring \"I'm a sociopath\", and that doesn't carry over ca. 370 pages - the book feels awfully long and frequently does what it criticizes, namely leaning into the stereotypes in order to use them to gain attention. Whether the author's name is a pseudonym or not is debated on the interwebs, and the legitimacy of her academic credentials are questioned - be it as it may, \"gagne\" is French for \"wins\". \"Patric Wins\", the name couldn't be more apt regarding her self-perception. You decide whether that's quirky or annoying. At the end of the day, Gagne is a person with lots of theoretical knowledge and personal experience regarding a highly stigmatized mental disorder, so the constant coquettish \"I'm a sociopath\" wouldn't have been required. The facts alone, smartly told, would have been enough.\n\nIn fact, I think she could have gone more in depth regarding treatments and scientific research on anti-social personality disorder. In short: This book would have needed a strict editor.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "A memoir on the misunderstood mental disorder of sociopathy written by a sociopath who has a PhD in clinical psychology? Um, hell yes. Sign me up.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Patric knew that she was different but she didn’t have the words to explain why. She didn’t feel fear, guilt, and empathy like the rest of her peers and the only way to relieve herself of the intense pressure that she felt in her head was to do something that she knew was wrong: lie, steal, enter peoples’ homes without permission. It wasn’t until she went to college and landed in a psychology class that she learned the word “sociopath” and everything began to fall in to place. From here, Patric began her astonishing journey towards self-discovery.\n\nThis memoir is so incredibly well written and is wildly informative. Gagne’s stories and experiences are interesting, shocking and eye-opening, challenging the reader to examine their own views and beliefs of sociopathy. I learned so much that I didn’t know before. Whether you think (or know) that you have sociopathy or whether you don’t, this is an incredible read regardless. I was glad to see that Gagne included how she eventually learned to cope with her sociopathy with the help of CBT and other modalities of therapy. I believe any sociopath (or person who loves a sociopath, for that matter) reaching for this book will find the information helpful. I dare say that anyone out there dealing with sociopathic behaviors and tendencies will feel relief as they read this memoir.\n\nThank you to NetGalley for my digital copy!

        "Review 10": "I have doubts about this author’s claims of expertise. The Chicago School, where she claims to have gotten her PhD, does not have PhD programs in clinical psychology. The term “sociopath” is not used by credible academic psychologists. Most (if not all) credible institutions publish doctoral dissertations, and hers is nowhere to be found.\n\nhttps://www.thechicagoschool.edu/acad...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/askpsycholog...\nShow more"

His simple, practical style and personal narratives make deep theological ideas both understandable and useful.\n\nWhy did I choose to listen to this book?\nBecause Comer's voice is warm and genuine, it feels like Comer is speaking just to you, encouraging and suggesting the way he lives out what it means to be a follower of Jesus.\n\nYou can check the audiobook version available too Practicing the Way: Be with Jesus, Become Like Him, Do As He Did\n\nThis is a resource for someone who is interested in hearing more about living a spiritual path that is transformative, personal, and life-giving.

        "Review 2": "There is some good here. JMC rightly points out that often the Gospel that is preached today is not the full gospel. People hear that they need to put their faith in Jesus so they can go to heaven, but they do not hear about how the Gospel changes their lives today. JMC also talks well about the heart and how following Jesus is more than just rules. I appreciate these things!\n\nHowever, I struggled with most of this book. Maybe it's because of how I've become so immersed in Reformed theology. :) I think JMC and I have different views on salvation and the Christian life and what those things entail (and honestly our overall theology). We would seemingly agree that salvation and life as a Christian are based on grace, but I think we would differ on to what extent. While he talks about grace, much of this book is about what we do to follow Jesus only as an apprentice of his. And, it almost seems throughout this book that Jesus is no more than a really good rabbi to JMC. He talks about him as the Son of God, but rarely. He seems to imply that we can be like Jesus here - perform miracles, prophesy, etc. - because he was the perfect man with the Holy Spirit, not Christ, the Son of God.\n\nI have lots of thoughts on this but overall struggle to see how this book is good news. With so much emphasis on doing and not enough emphasis on grace, JMC misses how Jesus is the beginning AND end of our salvation. Jesus not only justifies us but he sanctifies us and he is always interceding for us. I become like him because his Spirit is working in me. Of course there are means that he uses to do this work (like prayer, Bible reading, meditation, etc. like JMC talks about). But my becoming like him is a work that he does. That is good news.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "“In both my personal and pastoral experience, the problem is not that people don’t want to change (most do) or aren’t trying to change (most are); it’s that they do not know how to change. We don’t have a good grasp on how the human soul goes from spiritual birth to spiritual maturity. So we have a lot of spiritual adolescents, few elders.”\n\nThis is the problem John Mark Comer seeks to address in Practicing the Way, and he thoroughly succeeds. This book is the single best synthesis of the spiritual journey of being a disciple of Jesus that I have ever read. John Mark Comer brings together a historical perspective of discipleship with the wisdom of how we live this out in the modern world, and it is a brilliant work that will become an invaluable resource to the church in this age. As someone who has listened to many of John Mark’s teachings and read his other books, I view this as the compilation of much of his best work. To anyone outside of the Christian faith, this book is an invitation to take up a life of discipleship to Jesus, and to the church, it is an invitation to the rich depths of experiencing eternal life through knowing Jesus. John Mark balances the beauty of the vision of following Jesus with the immense practicality of crafting a rule of life in community, and the resources he gives for this in the back of the book are worth their weight in gold. This is a book that I will be coming back to many times, and I look forward to its official release to be able to share it with more people.\n\nThank you to Waterbrook/Multnomah and NetGalley for this advanced copy.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "I liked the concepts in this book and the huge number of quotes. It was a little too modern for me in that the narrative felt sparse. Still it would be a great graduate gift book. I also have some niggling concerns that I can’t quite articulate to myself.",

They’re really good additions, for sure, and definitely impressive showing he’s done hella research, but makes you wonder if you can say you wrote a book when it’s all other people’s quotes 🤔🤣 It would be one short book if it was just his content lol.

        "Review 6": "Thank you to Waterbrook/Multnomah and NetGalley for this advanced copy.\n\n\"Are you a christian or are you an apprentice,\" John Mark asks.\nBecause your answer matters and changes every move you make. Breezing through his introduction and a scattered synopsis of his last two books, Live No Lies,. and The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry (which are not essential pre-reads, but highly recommended), we find the core of John Mark's work: more than 7 years of lived communal (and longer personal) experience in a church practicing the Way together in Portland. The habituated rhythms of this community may form the bedrock of proof for John Mark's arguments, but the groundwork is laid using the most relevant of Jesus' teachings, a history of formation, and the best works of countless philosophers, sociologists, scientists, and writers from the past.\n\nJohn Mark has termed himself a \"popularizer\" which is an apt statement when half the chapters fill with +70 references to the authors he excavates for us. This tendency to borrow from other thinker's is not a crutch of his writing, but rather the power of it. Seamless, and at times extravagant, weaving of diverse thoughts allow each reader to glean a new voice that best fits their context while discovering prolific voices to follow. A narrative is built from the bones of past work across a myriad of fields.\n\nPracticing the Way leans most heavily into the practices John Mark has done cursory work on in previous books. His framing of a Rule of Life will be familiar to followers of Bridgetown church but revolutionary within this vital Apprenticeship framework provided. Ideas like the \"trellis and the vine\" and \"our working theory of change\" paint a picture of a faith that goes beyond Sunday mornings and transcends individualistic, self-help teachings at work today.\n\nThe pairing of this read with the blossoming organization of the same name unveils the vanguard of this micro-movement of followers committed to the future of the Church that is not modern, but ancient. It encapsulates the perfect introduction to the world of spiritual formation within a tight package of numerous jumping-off points for the curious reader. It does what even the best deep cuts of JMC's work (looking at you, God Has a Name and Garden City) try to do in answering our day's VITAL question, How do people change? and takes us to the starting point of a journey that can transform faith for the modern disciple of Jesus.\n\nIn short: it's very, very good.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "What does it mean to be a Christian? Ask 10 different people this question, and you may get 10 different answers that might range from political affiliation to church attendance. For this reason, John Mark Comer begins his latest book, Practicing the Way, with defining the terms.\nBecause \"Christian\" can mean different things to different people, he lays out a definition of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus. You'll have to read the book for yourself for the details, but the short answer is found in the subtitle: Be with Jesus, Become like him, and Do as he did.\nBasically, being a disciple or a follower of Jesus impacts not just what we do on Sundays, but our entire way of life. Therefore, as followers of Jesus, we must evaluate what we are being formed by, and who we are becoming. Does it look like Jesus? Comer argues that we are all being formed by something and into someone. The questions are, formed by what, and into who?\nWhat I love about John Mark Comer's style is that he can pull from so many different sources (he's a big Dallas Willard fan) but somehow bring them all together to share a familiar concept in a new and thought-provoking way. If you've read any of John Mark Comer's previous work, this will feel familiar, but not repetitive. If you're new to his writing, this is a great place to start.\nThe only thing I would have preferred to be different in this book is how it ended. He makes the case throughout that spiritual formation is not formulaic, but the note he ended on felt that way. That being said, I think there is a lot of good here and would recommend it as a launching point for intentional thinking about who we are becoming over time.\nThank you to Netgalley and WaterBrook & Multnomah for the advanced review copy.

        "Review 8": "Very good! It’s funnier and more witty than his other books which I liked. Reads pretty much like a culmination of his most prominent teachings over the years. I am a very active consumer of all things JMC so thats a little bit why I’m rating 4 instead of 5. It wasn’t anything revolutionary or new to me, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t thought provoking and convicting all the same. I feel like I must plug Garden City here because seriously that book changed the trajectory of my walk with God.\nSide: shoutout GK Chesterton that’s truly one of my favorite quotes of ALL time.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Really anything that reignites my excitement to follow Jesus is a huge win. Overall, this left me feeling like I wanted to know Jesus more and spend more time with Him. I kept thinking, this would be a great book to pass to someone who first comes to the faith then asks “so now what?” But I was challenged in several areas myself! I always appreciate Comer pushing the spiritual disciplines and giving lots of practical advice in that arena.\n\nIn an effort to track random, specific takeaways for my own sake:\n- when implementing more prayer, don’t feel bad about working WITH the kind of person I am. If I’m not a sit-in-silence-on-the-ground-for-an-hour person, I can prayer walk and build up the endurance for more solitude. I don’t have to be guilty that I’m a mover to think more clearly for now. I should just start there.\n- fasting. I want to think more about this as a nursing & TTC mother. I want to incorporate this discipline somehow? What could that look like?\n- always trying to further define sabbath for our family\n- i keep thinking “but what about my students and friends caught in deep abuse and suffering??” I know this all still applies in some way. JMC just wasn’t writing a book on suffering, he was writing a work on practicing The Way\n- it actually agree with his point that “is this bringing me closer to Jesus?” is a far more productive question than “is this sin?” Ex: asking “is waking up & scrolling Instagram SIN?!” Okay maybe not, but is it bringing me CLOSER to my Heavenly Father? I love the idea that we’re not just trying to avoid dirty sin, we’re trying to be so far above reproach that we’re chasing what would draw us near to Him.\n- the idea of a kind of prayer that isn’t actively saying anything but just sitting in God’s presence is a very freeing thought to me. I often don’t have a lot of good words.\n- I am very inspired and not scared by JMC’s “rules” for his life (solitude, screen time, etc.) I want more for myself. Thinking about this.\n- I do feel like the Lord has been nudging me for a while to wake up earlier and go down to the river we live right along. Need to try this as my “secret place.” And not view going somewhere to “just” pray as a waste of time! I was convicted that if I wasn’t reading a book or exercising (some favorite ways to rest), I almost view that as lost time. So I think God is calling me down to the river just to hear His voice.\nShow more",
        "Review 10": "I’m pretty sure I’ve read all of this author’s books at this point, and his commitment to following Christ above worldly ideals continues to impress me. John Mark Comer stays above the culture wars, citing teachings by everyone from the extremely progressive Rob Bell to the extremely conservative Rosaria Butterfield. The common denominator is that all the spiritual teachers he quotes are devoted to Jesus.\n\nIn this book, the author challenges Christians to go beyond believing in Christ to truly following him. It’s a book that encourages and convicts its readers in equal measure. It’s an invitation to give all you already have in return for something even better.\n\nMy favourite parts were the guidelines for creating a “rule of life” and the call to community. I absolutely loved the whole book and would recommend it to any Christian looking to deepen their faith.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "Synopsis: Supercommunicators looks at what makes some people exceptional at connecting with others. Executives, politicians, community leaders, and CIA operatives were all interviewed and highlighted in Supercommunicators to prove that communication is more about listening and making others feel heard rather than speaking.\n\nWhy does this book beguile? After his book, The Power of Habit, I was incredibly excited to get Duhigg's’ latest book as an ARC. I love learning about communication and ways to communicate better and more effectively. Supercommunicators is a great book if you’ve never explored material around empathy, listening, or communication. If you’re looking for a first book to launch you into the world of more effective communication, Supercommunicators will help you immensely.\n\nHowever, if you’ve read books like Dare to Lead by Brene Brown or Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss, most of this material will repeat what you’ve read. Because I’ve studied this material for a while, I found nothing groundbreaking or noteworthy. There were many good reminders of principles already learned, but nothing revelatory. I also feel strongly this book can be 100-150 pages shorter. Some of the anecdotes went on for far too long and felt disjointed from the point trying to be made.\nShow more",

        "Review 3": "This is my first book by Charles Duhigg. I have heard so much about his previous books around adjusting your habits to reach your goals. For years I have obsessively read business books and articles related to my field of work. Communication has always been pivotal in reaching goals in a corporate environment. This book is elaborating the various communication styles based on the following three elements:\n\n\"What´s this really about?\"\n\"How do we feel?\"\n\"Who are we?\"\n\nTraining your amygdala NOT to take over a conversation with sudden emotions, but rather manage your conversation styles according to the above elements is easier said than done.\nTherefore, I really loved the examples and consequences that Duhigg elaborated, when the conversation is not led in style. The examples vary from convincing agents in the CIA right the work culture of Netflix and to private households.\n\nObviously, asking questions as well as listening are major skills that a human being needs to master to lead an effective and efficient conversation.\n\nI also love the the win-win approach instead of the outdated approach to come out of a conversation as a so called \"winner\" whilst making your counterpart feel as a \"loser\".\n\nCommunication is a field that I always see room for improvement in my work as well private environment. Hence, I feel lucky to have read this ARC. Thanks to NetGalley and Charles Duhigg.\n\nCrystal-clear recommendation for everyone who seeks to improve their conversation style as well as manage difficult conversations.\n\nFind me on instagram\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Duhigg's book is so fun because it explains scientific findings with real-life examples, which renders the text entertaining and the findings easy to remember. At its core, the message is that we should analyze all communication regarding whether it's practical (positions vs. goals, much like in mediation), emotional (issues vs. feelings), and social. I especially want to emphasize that Duhigg employs the factor of identity as a chance to talk about what connects us, not what divides us, and I wish all participants in the great identity politics discussion would see the merit in this: Listening and bridging gaps creates the opportunity to find common ground and be heard in return.\n\nThese three areas are illuminated in a whole variety of situation, from the discussion around vaccines to the marriage counselor to the courtroom and many other environments. I listened to the audiobook, and the language of this pop science book is excellent, as it allows laypeople in the field of psychology (like me) to learn and have fun while being taken seriously. Actually, I assumed that Duhigg was a psychologist himself, but as it turns out, he's a journalist who does his job of explaining relevant issues to the public exceptionally well.\n\nThis is how popular non-fiction should be.\nShow more",

But this book was worth it, and I bought a copy for myself before I was even halfway through it, because it’s the kind of book I want to reread many times and also share with other people. Hopefully I can apply the lessons and be a better communicator myself.",
        "Review 6": "I never really read books that I would consider \"self-help\", but this title spoke to me, and I grabbed it on NetGalley.\n\nDuhigg's advice on how to connect with others seems pretty straightforward and in some ways, intuitive, but he uses fascinating examples to illuminate the lessons. I like case studies, and Duhigg doesn't boil them down to the point where all you get is a synopsis. These cases really do show the reader the pitfalls of not being more conscious, more thoughtful about how you communicate.\n\nI found the afterward to be the best part of this book. Duhigg shares a story about a longitudinal study that tracked people over a lifetime, and he selects two people's lives to highlight the importance of relationships to happiness. This beautiful afterward reminds us why communication is so critical to our lives and why being more cognizant about how we do it can be life altering.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Decent book about how to connect with someone and understand what kind of conversation you're having with people. Is it a problem solving conversation? Or is simply about emotional connection, venting or talking about identities? These are difficult things to tease out if you're not aware of the tells in a conversation and you can walk away talking with someone with complete and utter befuddlement. Don't problem solve when someone only wants to be heard. Listening isn't just closing your mouth and looking at someone, it's much more active. You can easily and unwittingly attack someone's identity simply by making casual talk with them. This was a nice and brief read that everyone should check out. Another similar book I enjoyed was How to Know a Person by David Brooks.\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "No star rating, as this clearly was NOT a book for me (I wasn't aware of that when reaching out for it).\n\nWhy not for me? This is a book about American communication for Americans. It relies on American culture and social patterns common to American society. While some general concepts are universal enough to apply in other geographies, the majority of \"tactical advice\" described in this book would not work in the EU (or Middle East, or Far East, or ...). For example: if you encounter someone in a professional situation, a person who you do not know privately, if such a person starts \"opening itself\" or asking you about private stuff (\"Where is your favorite vacation place?\") - the effect will be completely different in US and let's take: Nordic or Slavic countries.\n\nSome of the chapters were actually quite interesting (e.g. the one about Big Bang Theory or Netflix), but there were also some controversies - mostly in the final chapters about the identity. I was literally rolling my eyes reading through the chapter about identity's impact on test results (pure speculation, effect can be attributed to many actual causes, there are many counter-examples).\n\nTBH, I also disagreed a lot with the thesis presented in the Netflix chapter. It was supposed to be about communication, but it ended up being about snowflake-like fragility, an outrage mindset, and a lack of logical thinking (throwing a senior guy out because he has QUOTED a racist word, c'mon). Anyway, feel free to judge it for yourself.\n\nThe main concept of this book - to communicate with someone, you need to be able to empathize with them - is absolutely correct. But I didn't learn much beyond that obvious fact here. Sadly.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Honestly Charles Duhuigg write sself help books in a really easy to understand relatable way. Loved this book, especially after reading power of habit.

        "Review 10": "I'm not too sure what I think of this one.\n\nCharles Duhigg seems like a smart guy and is a good writer. Supercommunicators is well researched for what it is, and Duhigg has clearly put a lot of work into the book. As a whole, it is well written, easy to follow along with and helpfully provides an accompanying pdf with the audiobook, which is always a plus.\n\nDuhigg outlines four tips to 'having better conversations': (1) figure out what type of conversation you all want, (2) treat every conversation as a negotiation, (3) determine the emotions underneath the conversation and (4) address any identities at play within the conversation. Duhigg outlines these strategies very well. It is clear from the start of each chapter what the message is. His stories are convincingly told and everything is kept light enough that these tips feel more like signposts than cast iron rules.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room, this is a self-help book. I'm fundamentally opposed to the idea of 'self-help', or anything that might possibly improve me as a person on purpose. But I try, at least once a year, to dip into the pool of the second most popular type of writing behind romance. Duhigg's book is a fine example of the genre. It is intentionally vague and full of impressionist sentiment that sounds good on paper but has no practical or specific application. This is frustrating. Particularly in points (2) and (3), Duhigg's \"advice\" would make fortune cookies, greeting cards and horoscope writers blush. Moreover, the whole use of the term 'supercommunicator' is redundant, not simply because Duhigg himself stops using the term very much after the first couple of chapters.\n\nI could go on. But there is a more interesting debate here. Halfway through I noticed that I was growing increasingly dismissive of Duhigg's reliance on research and studies. This was primarily because they were studies attempting to quantify relationships and communication, which are as difficult to measure as the emotions of an octopus. My intuition is I won't be the only one who turns their nose up at such studies, and that took me down a wondering about why we put so much stock into scientific research compared to sociological research. Duhigg's reliance on studies and experiments is no more egregious than popular science books that rely on university papers and novel laboratory work.\n\nThe final part is the most effective. Duhigg explores the reasons why conversations around identity are tough to navigate. It is here where he actually offers something that might practically benefit a wide part of the population. The arguments were strongly made and, despite still turning into a over juiced watercolour at the end, generally stuck to the points Duhigg wanted to make. I'd cautiously recommend the book for the final point alone, if only becasue it actually offers something worthwhile to the wider issues of identity politics today. Still, maybe check if you can rent it from a library, or borrow it off your pal who uses Huel.\n\nIn all seriousness, I am conflicted on this. A big part of it is my own prejudice against self-help book and Duhigg's writing has put me in a slight dilemma. I do not rate the vague platitudes or reductionist platitudes. But somewhere amongst the miasma of nothingness there are some genuinely interesting discussions happening. Duhigg's skill in making it just vague enough so that any incorrect application of these 'skills' cannot backfire specifically on him is also pretty appealing.\n\nOn the whole, if you like self-help books and are interested in communication, there are plenty of worse books out there. Otherwise, spend your income on things that actually help you; booze, takeaways and donating to charity.\nShow more"

        "Review 3": "They could never make me hate you Gypsy-Rose!\nMy Time to Stand follows the true story of Gypsy-Rose and Dee Dee's lives from her grandfather's abuse all the way to the present day. While it isn't a work of literary genius by any means, there is power in Gypsy-Rose finally sharing her story in her own words. This memoir reads like it came from someone who lacked education and social interactions as a child, and I don't mean that as an insult. The quality of the memoir is simply reflective of who Gypsy-Rose is and the events that shaped her.\n\nI'm rating this memoir 3 stars for a few reasons. The first being that there are a handful of line editing mistakes. I noticed multiple occurrences of words being mistyped, flipped with another word in a sentence, or words just completely missing from the sentence. For someone whose case has been very high profile, I expected better in terms of editing.\n\nThere is also a distinct lack of details in some parts of the text. In those moments, My Time to Stand felt like I was just rewatching The Act. I hoped that within these pages, readers would be able to really get into Gypsy-Rose's head during critical moments in her life. I wanted to feel wrapped inside her story and become close with it. But it felt more like we were sitting on the couch and she was recounting her narrative to me. This is what I mean when I say My Time to Stand is not literary. If you're hoping for a well-written memoir, this won't be it. That's not to say it isn't worth reading. I simply found myself wanting more from the authors and waiting for that moment when the world around me melted and it became just me and this story.\n\nUltimately, though, I find My Time to Stand to be a vital memoir in a time when women's medical care is being determined by politicians and millions of us no longer feel as safe around doctors. This is a woman who was failed by the medical system, by the government, the prison system, by her family, neighbors, and above all her mother. She was a child who was left behind and abused for two decades. This is the story of someone who faced power disparities all her life, who was tortured physically and emotionally. In 2025, when we are awaiting the inauguration of a fascist administration that intends to strip women of their rights, imprison children at the border, and silence the voices of the people, My Time to Stand becomes a narrative that's reflective of this country's worst problems and the endangerment many of us face at the hands of our politicians.\n\nAnd finally, Gypsy-Rose's memoir ends on an uplifting note that leaves the reader feeling satisfied with the conclusion and hopeful for the author's future. I am a GRB empathizer and believe there were many, many times when she was wronged by medical professionals and the government. I hate knowing that this woman was forced to live in jail for eight and a half years. Gypsy-Rose had no business being sent to prison for defending herself against her abuser and frankly I find it disgusting that the law did not do her justice throughout her sentencing. This country has police officers killing innocent people on the street but when a woman has been imprisoned and abused against her will by the one person who is supposed to love her unconditionally makes the hard decision to end that person's life, she is left to rot in solitary confinement. However, Gypsy-Rose seems to feel positively about her future and her freedom, hoping to establish change in the medical industry and prevent other children from suffering from Munchausen by proxy.\n\nFor readers looking to find similar books, I would highly recommend Minka Kelly's Tell Me Everything, Jennette McCurdy's I'm Glad My Mom Died, Britney Spears' The Woman In Me, and Paris Hilton's Paris: The Memoir.\n\n(Note to those just reading my review: most of the comments are from when I first added this book to my TBR. My \"review\" at that time was the very first one posted on this book, and unfortunately it did elicit a little bit of negative attention. Pay those review bombers no mind.)\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Gypsy-Rose Blanchard has a history of lying. This is something she's openly admitted to in various interviews. She tends to speak of her dishonesty like she's moved beyond it; however, she continues to be caught in lie after lie, most recently in a People magazine article that came out a mere day before this book's release.\n\nStill, I wanted to be fair and actually read her new book before leaving a review. So I read it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I found that \"My Time to Stand\" not only contains multiple inconsistencies within its own pages -- Blanchard also contradicts several statements that she's made in the past about her upbringing.\n\nFor example, in the book she writes about her mother Dee Dee's aversion to Barbie dolls. Yet in her 2019 interview with Dr. Phil, Blanchard told him (twice) that Dee Dee ordered her to play with her Barbies. Why would she even have Barbies if Dee Dee disliked them so much?\n\nAnother example concerns her education. In that same Dr. Phil interview, Blanchard claimed that she never attended school -- not even kindergarten. Meanwhile, a petition for early release circulated by her father, Rod, during her incarceration (which Blanchard was well aware of and encouraged people to share) said that she attended school through second grade. Now, in \"My Time to Stand\", she states that Dee Dee pulled her out of school right after kindergarten (later in the book, this becomes \"around pre-K age\"). Which is it?\n\nThen there's the matter of Blanchard's teeth. Her past suggestions and explanations for why the majority of them were extracted range from unnecessary chemotherapy (as somebody who's been on chemo, I can say it's highly unlikely that any doctor ever ordered it for her unless she truly needed it) to Dee Dee plowing her with anti-seizure medication.\n\nIn \"My Time to Stand\", Blanchard blames the medication. Well, until several chapters later -- when she implies that her poor dental health resulted from sucking on a baby bottle until her 20's (indeed this is the most probable contributing factor to the loss of her teeth, perhaps along with her known penchant for sugary soda).\n\nI might sound like I'm nitpicking with these examples. However, Blanchard's memoir includes plenty more contradictions and details that have suddenly changed from what she said in the past. Combined with her self-acknowledged history of lying, it makes it very difficult to trust her accusations against her mother, her grandfather, and her co-defendant, Nick Godejohn.\n\nGodejohn in particular is portrayed as some kind of sadistic caricature in \"My Time to Stand\". He's no saint in real life; but the hundreds of text messages documenting his relationship with Blanchard show that neither is she. Nor was she ever the innocent submissive that she paints herself as in her memoir.\n\nThe new anecdotes revealed in Blanchard's book also stretch credulity. This includes the bit about how, following Blanchard's eye surgery, a hospital let Dee Dee push her daughter out to their car in a borrowed wheelchair (which Dee Dee proceeded to steal) without any staff members present. Come on. A hospital's not going to take that risk.\n\nAnd the dream Blanchard writes about involving her father and stepmother comes across like 100% pure fiction -- to the extent that I almost felt embarrassed just reading the words.\n\nOn top of everything else, Blanchard's memoir simply isn't very well-structured. A chapter where she rambles about her medical records (which seems stuck at random in the middle of two barely-related chapters) feels especially out-of-place.\n\nMy opinion is that Blanchard used \"My Time to Stand\" as a way to address and make excuses for the many valid concerns voiced by her critics. But after reading it, I remain more skeptical than ever of Blanchard's ability to tell the truth.\nShow more",

She just wanted to give Gypsy everything. She conned people to get her trips, a house, etc., but Gypsy lived a better life than most of us. Towards the end of her mom’s life, she was actually afraid of Gypsy. Her mom was very ill, and Gypsy literally could have just left. She was legally an adult. She did NOT have to plan for two years to have her mom unalived by a man with autism, low IQ, who was collecting a permanent disability check.\nWhen she was arrested and was being interrogated, not once did she mention to the detective that her mom abused her! That would have been the perfect opportunity to tell her story. All she said was that her mom was overprotective. She said she was her best friend. Well, you don’t unalive your best friend.\nShe has been caught in many lies. She tells so many that she can’t keep track of what she’s said. So , pretty much, this is a complete book of lies.

Shame on the editors for allowing misleading and misinformation more broadly into this - gypsy herself admitted to micro deletion but insists her surgeries were unnecessary. However, the ones she describes are consistent with mitigating symptoms of the micro deletion. I wanted to give benefit of the doubt but I did not expect so much emphasis on sex to the point where I felt triggered. Very disappointed with this.\n\nAlso, the constant lying in this is horrific.

An absolutely fantastic memoir - the experiences of autistic women are much needed, and as an autistic woman myself, I found Fern Brady's experiences to be incredibly relatable and refreshing. This is a memoir I will hold close to my heart for a long time to come-",
        "Review 5": "Autism has become a hot topic in recent years. Diagnoses have increased massively, the possible link to vaccines was raised and debunked (but persists), possible “treatments” are fiercely debated, Asperger’s has been deprecated as a label, and awareness has grown of how symptoms in girls and women usually differ from the more familiar male tropes (it’s the intensity of obsession that’s significant, not that they’re inherently niche). That’s reflected in the popularity of fictional protagonists who seem to be “on the spectrum”, even if it’s not explicitly stated.\n\nLike many allistic (non-autistic) neurotypicals, I know a variety of autistic people. I have also watched documentaries by Temple Grandin, read a fair bit about autism, and think I have thought I had some understanding of how it can present and feel. This book opened my eyes far wider, especially about autistic women. Brady has a knack for explaining things in an authoritative (with footnotes to research articles) and relatable way, without ever talking down to the reader.\n\nParts of it are shocking, parts are funny, some of it is both. All of it is informative and compelling: I read it in a single day.\n\n“If you’ve ever started school midway through the school year or been the new person at work and felt lost - it’s that feeling. Except you never just pick up on stuff or fall in line eventually; it’s a constant sense that everyone is in a WhatsApp group you don’t know about.”\n\n\n\nImage: Increased risks for women and AFAB with autism: victimisation, PTSD, suicidality, depression, anxiety, and co-occurring health conditions, BUT less likely to be diagnosed than men/AMAB (Source)\n\nMemoir\n\nFern Brady is a standup comedian from a working class Roman Catholic family in a small town between Glasgow and Edinburgh. I first encountered her in Series 14 of Taskmaster, in 2022. This book was published in 2023, when she was in her mid-thirties.\n\nAs a child, she was clever, bored, solitary (her best friend was a tree), and deemed bad and difficult. She first attempted suicide aged eight. At a teen mental health unit, she was told she couldn’t be autistic because she made eye contact and had a boyfriend. She eventually escaped to university:\n“I didn't have to kill myself for now.”\nBut she didn’t fit in there either (social class became another axis of difference), though she did eventually graduate.\n\nShe abused medication and weed, self-harmed, got into debt, had episodes of homeless sofa-surfing, lots of casual sex with men and women, at least one very abusive relationship, and worked as a stripper. She describes stripping as another type of masking, and somewhat positive: routine, rules, bouncers to evict anyone problematic, it’s hard to get sacked, and the misogyny was visible and clear.\n\nShe was eventually diagnosed as autistic during Covid lockdown, and discusses some of the conditions and circumstances that are more common in autistic people, such as OCD, depression, PTSD, eating disorders, ADHD, and alexithymia (limited ability to recognise and describe emotions).\n\n\n\nImage: Autism signs in women: camouflaging, sensory sensitivities, anxiety or depression, emotionally sensitive, people-pleasing, difficulty fitting in, mirroring others, difficulties with friendships, appears shy, stimming, intense interests, feeling misunderstood, and social difficulties (Source)\n\nMeltdowns\n\n“Trying to stop a meltdown feels similar to trying to hold your breath.”\nBrady says this is not discussed enough, and I agree. I had no idea that meltdowns (literally smashing up her home) were an issue for high-functioning adults, let alone those, like Brady, with a successful career, a supportive partner, and with a diagnosis that finally makes sense of her place in the world. She likens them to explosive diarrhoea: she can usually postpone them until she gets home, or away from people, but not always.\n\nMeltdowns are a consequence of ignoring sensory over-stimulation; they’re not about anger or being manipulative. Hitting herself over the head is:\n“Akin to someone slapping an analogue telly that’s on the blink.”\n\nShe says arresting people having meltdowns (including children, and she cites specific cases) is like saying epilepsy is demonic.\n\nThere are also shutdowns, which are less dramatic, and just look like sulking.\n\nFamily\n\nBrady sees her parents as driven by over-protective instincts, and a strong desire to avoid family shame. At 14, she didn’t know how to catch a bus, and shocked her mother, first by buying tampons, and later by taking the initiative to access contraception. Nevertheless, her mother nurtured her puzzling passion for books, theatre club, piano lessons, and obscure foreign languages.\n\nIn a very telling passage, she compares memories of being a flower girl at a wedding. As the family tell it, she was wearing a pretty dress, then “for no reason”, she had a meltdown (screaming and tearing her dress), “exactly like the child from The Omen”, and was taken outside and slapped. Despite being given some Chewits (candy), she wouldn’t pose for photos.\n“My recollection of it is this: a group of people stopped me from playing and put me in an itchy lace dress that felt like fire ants crawling all over my skin. They then braided my hair so tightly my entire scalp felt like it was being clamped in a vice. I ran out to the garden… to try to get rid of the unbearable feeling… Someone beat me and dragged me back inside, tightly re-braiding my hair… I’d venture a guess that no one who has just experienced a meltdown is up for doing a photo shoot, with or without Chewits.”\n\n\n\nImage: Masking tactics (hiding autistic behaviours, mimicking others' social behaviours including eye contact and gestures, and pre-preparing phrases, jokes and conversations) and possible consequences (burnout, sensory overload, emotional overload, chronic anxiety, delayed diagnosis) (Source)\n\nQuotes\n\n• “People would impose their friendship on me” - and often, take advantage of her credulity.\n\n• “Every attempt to fit in resulted in me being more weird and more isolated from normal people.”\n\n• “If you could be fluent in a foreign language then surely you could become fluent in social skills.” Or so she thought, as she searched online for tips, which she then applied over-specifically.\n\n• “I tried and failed to be the best at masking.”\n“All I felt was the suffocating horror that I was failing at being clever.”\n\n• “Autistic women speak out of turn a lot… [with] direct honesty… [and] an almost childlike sense of injustice.”\n\n• “Honesty is powerful but it’s not something that comes easily to allistic people because they’re so driven to fit in with others that they prize collective values over truth.” She explains it’s probably why autistic people often fail to get parole: they don’t express false regret.\n\n• “Autistic people often require much lower doses of antidepressants than non-autistic people do. Her [Temple Grandin’s] argument is that our nervous systems are so sensitive that we need less of everything - alcohol, recreational drugs, caffeine - for it to have an impact.”\n\n• “I believe there’s a significant number of autistic women who have sex freely because we’ve little regard for gender norms or complex social hierarchies (for example, promiscuity carries a heavy social cost as a woman) and it’s sensorily enjoyable.”\n\n• “The dropout rate for autistic [university] students is ten times higher than for non-autistic students and it’s thought that’s because most students tend to help each other by ‘crowdsourcing’ information from their peers”, like where the lecture theatre is and how to work the washing machine.”\n\n• “Defining yourself as the girlfriend of someone impressive was easier than working out who you were… especially if you’re a weird woman.”\n\n• “If you’re prepared to be thin you will be rewarded with money and status… in short supply for most autistic women.”\n\n• “I frequently had the sense that a madwoman was driving the car of my life while I sat in the back seat observing.”\n\nAutism in fiction\n\nIn contrast to Brady’s “own voices” memoir, here are some novels that seem to have a main character who is on the spectrum, and whose authors are not, as far as I know, autistic. This is a very unscientific list, but I spot a pattern:\n\n• Bonnie Garmus’ Lessons in Chemistry, 2022 (woman). See my 2* review HERE.\n\n• Catherine Lacey’s Pew, 2020 (adult of ambiguous gender).

        "Review 8": "This book pulls no punches. Fern Brady's childhood and early adulthood as an undiagnosed autistic woman reads like a hurricane of trauma. She makes it clear that she's not out of the storm, having to unpack years of masking and battle societal pressures to be neurotypical, but the fact that she's written this book is so important.\n\nI think it achieves her intention of bringing awareness to a disability that is still not properly understood, especially when it manifests in women and girls – and it achieves it without sugarcoating or shying away from traumatic or devastating experiences. It's her matter-of-fact way of writing and observing the world that shows how difficult and frustrating it is to be in a society that never says what it means, or means what it says. Especially as she, as a woman, has a view of herself, her body, her sexuality, her talent and worth, in a way that society can't quite infiltrate. It's enviable. But it just goes to show how women bend themselves into all sorts of shapes just to fit in; I can't imagine what it's like being autistic under all that existing pressure.\n\nI found the book really readable, although I often struggled to find the flow of it. I was aware that there was (to use the damned phrase) \"a journey of discovery\" going on, but sometimes the narrative jumped about and I wasn't quite sure what order events occurred, and it felt more like a list of events than anything else. But I really liked her (often brutal) honesty and observation. Definitely worth a read if you want to learn more about what it's like to live (and hide your life) as an autistic woman – but buckle in. It's a rollercoaster.\n\n[Thanks to Octopus Books for sending me a proof!]\nShow more",

The number of insults in this book directed at people she didn’t even interact with was wild.

I really enjoyed the opening chapters about setting a vision. He says without a clear vision, how do you know where you’re going? People often float in their lives then wonder how they got to where they are today.\n\nI also loved this opening part in his chapter titled “Work Your Ass Off”:\n\n\n\nI bet you and I have a lot in common. We’re not the strongest, smartest, or richest people we know. We are not the fastest or the most connected. We’re not the best looking or the most talented. We don’t have the best genetics, but what we DO have is something a lot of other people don’t have — the willingness to work. If there’s one unavoidable truth in this world, it’s that there is no substitute for putting in the work.\n\n\n\nThis would be a 5 star if there wasn’t an element of delusion to the book. Arnold acknowledges that he’s been given advantages by his start in bodybuilding that led to his ability to get into movie making and politics, but he pushes “hard work” throughout the whole book, rarely showing much empathy for individuals with limitations. He himself says that he “has good genetics” and “never gets tired”. At one point, he talks about how we all have 24 hours in a day and we can all give time to our goals - no excuses. He says that people ask him about when is a good time for rest and relaxation, and he says “naps are for babies, relaxing is for the retired”. I love Arnold, but parts like this alienated me from his message.\n\nOverall, it was a motivating read and I walked away with a deeper understanding of “Be Useful” and what that means. I still love Schwarzenegger and all he stands for - an inspiration & a great read when you need a kick in the pants.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Be Useful by Arnold Schwarzenegger is a quick and fascinating read. From his life’s experiences, Schwarzenegger lays out how he was able to achieve so much while coming from humble beginnings.\n\nSchwarzenegger begins with having a clear vision. If you don’t have it, then start with creating little goals and keep completing them; day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year. The process never ends as life is a continuous journey of growth.\n\nIn Austria, Schwarzenegger got inspired by then famous bodybuilder and made it his goal to become the best in the field. So he went from vision to action. He felt passionate about bodybuilding. Thus, he felt like it wasn’t a matter of discipline for him to go to the gym as he loved doing it.\n\nIt was interesting to read how refreshing walks are and how many famous people used walks to create their time and space and were creative within that time and space.\n\nDream big. Ignore naysayers. He used any kind of negativity into motivation. No plan Bs as that would be already setting plan A for failure.\n\n“Fulfilling a dream gives you the power to see further and deeper – further out into the world toward what is possible, and deeper into yourself to what you are capable of.”\n\n“I learned that the only limits that truly exist are in our minds.”\n\nThe will to work is important part. You have to be diligent and consistent in your work.\n\nAfter retiring from bodybuilding, he went into acting, then politics, and now philanthropy as you need to continue setting new goals.\n\nHis harsh childhood didn’t break his spirit, it rather helped him to find his passion and purpose. He chose the higher road and became his own creator, rather than taking a negative approach and blaming the system. I find his story and his ethics to make something of himself very inspiring.\n\nMy favorite chapter-title is “Shut Your Mouth, Open Your Mind.” In this chapter, he talks about the lesson he received from his first mentor who supported him in his dream of bodybuilding, who told him that he “can’t just be hungry for success and money and fame and muscles. We have to be hungry for knowledge as well… the world was the ultimate classroom, and that we need to be like a sponge, soaking up as much of it as we could…always be curious…it was better to ask good questions than to make smart statements.” Listen, learn, and grow.\n\nI set to write a short review, but Schwarzenegger’s life’s journey is truly fascinating, how he propelled himself up, his high ethics, and the phenomenal drive to achieve unimaginable. This non-fiction is filled with his life’s stories which support what he aspired to do and continues to do.\n\nTRENDING INSPIRATION: Be Useful\n\nhttps://biopurposeland.blogspot.com/\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "Due to the prevalence of online reels/stories, I've become increasingly aware of Arnold's philosophies around work, life and how to succeed. I've often been surprised by how inciteful a few-minute clip could be. I was, therefore, keen to read this book on release.\n\nI got the E-book (for highlighting purposes) and audiobook as he performed it.\nThe audiobook is excellent, He reads the book but also elaborates on certain points, more than the text of the E-book. It's like listening to him chat rather than reading a book.\n\nThe content is split into tools, with each one being backed by his life experiences, sometimes in very direct and unflinching terms.\nMany of the tools are straightforward, and common sense but that does not mean they are 'less than'.\nThe simplicity of the tools is actually a huge benefit. Anyone can implement them, just 'Wenn Schon, Denn Schon'.\n(Roughly translated, it means “If you’re going to do something, DO IT. Go all out.”)\n\nThis could be a 'one-sitting book' due to its length but don't let that fool you.\nI would have finished much quicker if I didn't have to take as many notes, highlight passages and jot down ideas. A prime example is Chapter 3. Do your own '24-Hour Countdown' rather than just reading it. It's eye-opening.\n\nFive stars.\nShow more",

        "Review 7": "While I'll admit that I find it very charming to listen to Arnold read this book, unfortunately a lot of it is steeped in \"Boomer advice\".\nDon't play video games, have fun at work, only ever work towards a goal.

        "Review 8": "3.5 stars rounded down — I appreciate Schwarzenegger's calm yet driven perspective on life, as well as his servant’s heart. \"Be Useful\" is a good primer on finding your goals and on how to live a life that is true to yourself. Given the title, I did expect the book to be focused a bit more on finding your purpose vs. just setting a goal. There is a chapter solidly dedicated to encouraging others to find ways to serve others, but overall I came away with more of a \"be relentless\" theme than \"serve yourself by serving others.\" Schwarzenegger advocates personal responsibility for your own destiny, yet avoids the trap of blind privilege by also being adamantly clear that he did not achieve his success on his own.\n\nThe narrative is a little bit scattered at times, such as when he suddenly begins discussing the benefits of taking a walk, in depth, in the middle of a seemingly unrelated chapter. Having read a number of memoirs and self-help books, for me \"Be Useful\" landed squarely in the middle of the pack, but wasn't without benefit. It's a great book for seeing all the various sides of Schwarzenegger and exposing yourself to a little inspiration on the way.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "This was a buddy read with Simon. We truly enjoyed it. Arnold Schwarzenegger entertained, engaged and inspired us as we listened to his resonant voice reading his own words. Here are the highlights:\n\nFrom the introduction: \"Every color, creed and orientation in a rainbow of humanity.\"\n\nFrom Chapter 1: Have a Clear Vision:\n\n\"A 2004 study by the researchers at Stanford University showed that walking increased the creative thinking of 100% of the study participants.\"\n\n\"You need to be able to see what you want to achieve before you do it not as you do it.\"\n\nFrom Chapter 3: Work Your Ass Off:\n\nRegarding how to be successful in life - \"American Country singer and sausage maker Jimmy Dean nailed it, he said, \"Do what you say you are going to do and try to do it a little bit better than you said you would.\" In other words, under promise and over deliver.\n\nFrom Chapter 5: Shift Gears:\n\n\"I have a rule, no complaining about a situation unless you're prepared to do something to make it better.\"\n\nFrom Chapter 7: Break Your Mirrors:\n\nMy main take away from this chapters was about how reliant we are on others, how we learn and grow because of the various characters we come across. For example, we are all trying to make ourselves better because of the people in our lives, whether they had a positive or negative influence, they motivate us to change. We either learn what we want to become, or what we do not want to become.\n\nSchwarzenegger doesn't like the term 'self-made man' as he believes that \"None of us have ever done anything on our own, when you really think about it. We have always had help or guidance.\"\n\n\"Give back, pay it forward. Be useful as often as you can.\"\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "I was enthralled with Helen Garner’s quest to connect with her grandson, turning from boy to man, across the season of AFL. The training, the games, the team, and their camaraderie. The OBSERVATION of this. Who better to bear witness than this author, I think I’m quite enamoured by HG. Not at all a worry to be the furthest thing from a footy fan.\n\nAsking questions, uncaring if they are simple, inane or something that any fan would already know. I love this about her, it’s what I do. Question, question, question. \"Why does mullet equal footy?' Is this not the best?!\n\nBeing a neighbour to her kin, this family is lovely to observe. The honesty appealing and welcomed, entirely clear their love is strong and real. Her grandson WANTS to be with her. So often they hang out.\n\nI feel old and deaf and awed, in the back seat with the dog.\n\nI sense her awareness of ageing, stating, not emoting. I was fully absorbed in the sparseness of writing. A little rush of desolation. It doesn't matter if I'm not there. No one needs me. I'm not essential after all. I'm only a witness. It's one of the sporadic bursts of reality that grandparents have to bear. You're making a serious mistake if you start to think you're near the centre. You're on the periphery. You're a servant. A hanger-on. And soon you'll be dead.\n\nFully committed to transporting Amby, soaking in the pre training excitement, a fabulous time to ask questions of her boy.\n\nWhere am I going to put myself, with my brand-new notebook hidden in the back pocket of my overalls? Vowing to remain unseen, Amby did comment offhandedly that he didn’t ever notice her presence. A little stab to my heart!\n\nHelen is funny, deprecating. I loved it to bits. ..despite his absurd little moustache (they're all growing them-it's a thing in the AFL and even on the streets, for God's sake)..\n\nLittle tid bits, and the free-flowing convo between these two. What? They pinch you? Isn't pinching sort of girly? Is it allowed?\n\nthe women runners with their whirling ponytails and cold-beamed little head-torches. Some of them are wiry and feet, with the smooth, economical movements of marathon runners; others are plump, with big hips, bellies and breasts.. Is this not the Helen we all love?\n\nRemarking on her lack of understanding the game, uncaring. I walk around the house thinking ignorantly about it, shouting, singing, talking to myself. All the time. Does this mean something about me? Something psycho, or scary?\n\nThe voyeuristic style transported me to the cold nights, not being a fan of the cold, I felt her chill each time she forgot her coat, or when it was too thin. Each nugget of observation was necessary, adding many layers to the narrative. The book is small, the content not at all. The Season highlights that possibly HG has self-doubt like the rest of us, but what a delight it was to see her enjoy her grandson and take pleasure in these few months. To reflect on his changes since carrying him around so heavy on the hip, and revel in the joy of it all. Present for her grandson, regardless of being seen or not, the value of her company and spiritedness was priceless.\n\nThank you @text_publishing for my review copy, I cheered for all of this.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "Reading like a very natural extension of her diaries, this warmly observed year of U16 footy, AFL and family life is glorious. Garner gently questions and probes the ethics of memoir of this kind and as much as she wants to be an invisible observer, her delight at being asked to hand out the orange slices to these towering mud-covered boys at half-time is palpable (and adorable). That she still carries so much self-doubt about writing and actually sees it as part of her process will reassure writers and other artists no end (or perhaps depress them, does it never end?). What a gift to be able to be back in Garner’s life and world so intimately. Sorry for reading this so early and torturing you. Here’s to Helen, long may she reign.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Garner’s passion, candour and inimitable prose will lift your soul in this lovingly detailed unfolding of her teenage grandson’s football season.

        "Review 4": "This short high audiobook is pwrfect for fans of football and coming of age honesty.

I love AFL I knew I'd love this book but it hit me even harder than I expected. \"A nanna's book about football\" I found myself so touched by the relationship between Garner and her grandson, the contemplation on the cycles of life - he growing up as she's preparing for her death, love and friendship and the idea of sport as something that can bring us together. I was actually moved by this, of my favourite pieces of media on sport ever! Switched to the audiobook halfway through which I recommend because she narrates it herself. 5/5.\nShow more",

But beyond both is a secret life that baffles us… If it is a question that can never be answered, it is still the question we must keep asking, if only in order to understand that life is never binary, nor reducible to cant or code, but a mystery we at best apprehend. In Chekhov’s stories, the only fools are those with answers.\n\nThe question was, What is a structure of atom? And the answer was an atomic bomb…\nThe question was, How could H. G. Wells write such crap as Marriage? And the answer was a love affair of the author with the critic…\nRichard Flanagan starts the novel recalling his father…\n\nHe saw the world aslant.

        "Review 2": "‘Experience is but a moment. Making sense of that moment is a life.’\n\nIn Richard Flanagan’s own words, this book is ‘no more than a love note to my parents and my island home, a world that has vanished’, but indeed it IS more than that. Part simple memoir, part Labatut-esque lightly fictionalised history that presents a concatenation of events with the bombing of Hiroshima at its centre, and which ultimately results in Flanagan’s own birth.\n\nThe simple memoir — the ‘love note’ — is easily the stronger portion of the book for me. It displays a restraint I have not seen before in Flanagan’s work and yet is powerfully emotional. Portraits of his parents, assorted relatives, and a Tasmanian way of life passing out of living memory are rendered with economical clarity — ‘My father remembered how the coming of electric light killed ghost stories’ — while encompassing too, the much more ancient way of life that preceded it: ‘If this book were the forty thousand years (Aboriginal people) have existed on this island, Europeans would enter the story only in the last page and a half.’\n\nBraided through this personal memoir is a daisy chain of historical events, connecting H.G. Wells’ writing of The World Set Free to the creation of the bomb it prophesied. This section is also very well done, although it is more straightforward and minimal in comparison to Benjamin Labatut’s complex webs of connections, and suffers a little for the comparison. I bristled a little at Flanagan’s tendency to assign cause-and-effect (‘a novel destroyed Hiroshima and without Hiroshima there is no me’) to multifactorial events, even while admiring the artistic result.\n\nAs someone with a strong bias towards fiction, it comes as a nice surprise that this non-fiction work is my favourite of Flanagan’s books so far. 4.5 stars.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "I love this kind of book. I just can't quite tell how much I love this specific one.\n\nQuestion 7 is a big, discursive, multidisciplinary chunk of life-writing from Australian author Richard Flanagan, which mixes memoir, literary history, travel writing, and philosophical musings on everything from ethics to colonialism to class.\n\nMost of all, perhaps, it's about the contingency of reality – the extreme unlikelihood of having ended up where we are today. Flanagan is only here because his father survived the Japanese POW camps; camps he survived only because the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima; a bomb which was dropped only because physicist Leo Szilard came up with the concept of the nuclear chain reaction; a concept Szilard only came up with because he had read the HG Wells novel The World Set Free; a novel Wells only wrote because he was trying to get over a break-up with his lover Rebecca West; and on and on and on…\n\nFlanagan tells all of these stories simultaneously, and the juxtaposition is wildly productive. What emerges is a sense of how the present is jumbled-up with the past and the future, and cannot be disentangled from either of them – something fiction struggles to deal with, he suggests, since ‘all writing is trapped in tenses when life isn't’.\n\nWell, possibly. Flanagan slightly loses me when he starts waxing metaphysical; he is strongest when concentrating on the facts, many of those he turns up being new to me and rather surprising. I was amazed, for instance, to find that HG Wells is linked not only to the birth of nuclear weapons (through Szilard), but also to the colonial past of Flanagan's homeland: ‘The War of the Worlds had its genesis in the attempted genocide of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people,’ something which indeed is referenced explicitly in Wells's novel.\n\nOn Tasmania Question 7 is excellent, better than many a longer book on the complicated past of that extraordinary island. ‘The Tasmanian story,’ Flanagan says, ‘is the ur-story of the end of the world, much imitated and never rivalled.’ He is particularly excoriating on the tendency of the British to shake their heads (as the Independent newspaper did in 2009) over the fact that ‘white Australians still struggle to come to terms with their colonial past’ – as if, Flanagan fumes,\n\n\nthe genocide was our invention and not theirs, as though the totalitarian slave system was our choice and not their gulag. How marvellous, to have an empire, reap its robbed riches, and yet etch its colonial failings on the colonised, to write on our bodies that we were the vulgar arriviste, the barbarian, the savage, that their judgement was our crime.\n\n\nIt's this colonial awareness of the past that infuses the whole book, giving it a sense of generalised gloomy responsibility. ‘No one is exempt from guilt,’ he says; and, elsewhere, ‘There is no memory without shame.’\n\nUnfortunately, Flanagan doesn't confine himself to interesting facts and reflections only, preferring to reach towards something more philosophical and, to my taste, less meaningful. The book takes its title from a short story by Chekhov making fun of exam questions. Chekhov's question seven reads:\n\n\nWednesday, June 17, 1881, a train had to leave station A at 3 a.m. in order to reach station B at 11 p.m.; just as the train was about to depart, however, an order came that the train had to reach station B by 7 p.m. Who loves longer, a man or a woman?\n\n\nFlanagan takes this as emblematic – though of what, I'm still not sure. Of the absurdity of fact, perhaps. He comes back to it in all kinds of contexts where it seems of dubious relevance or taste. The underlying problem is that he's very suspicious (as is clear from some of his fiction) of ‘history’, and he discusses this a little when he talks about his time at Oxford:\n\n\nI studied history, an idea of time formed over 3000 years of human experience in Europe, which, I discovered, made perfect sense of European time, stopping at all the stations of European progress and European thought. […] But it made no sense of Tasmania.\n\n\nThis leads him to denounce the ‘lies we call time, history, reality, memory, detail, facts’. But these things are not the same. Memory may lie, but history and facts are not lies, pretty much by definition – and it's actually of crucial importance to Flanagan's book that they're not, since it's based very specifically on the baffling teleology of how things actually took place. If this is a story of things that may have happened a bit like this or may not, then it has no value at all.\n\nBecause the bomb over Hiroshima contained four silk bags of cordite to start the chain reaction, and because the exact death toll is not known, Flanagan finds himself writing: ‘all that can be said with absolute certainty is that soaring as pure energy and vaporised fragments towards the heavens that morning…were four silk powder bags.’ Of course it's not factually true that this is all that can be said about Hiroshima, but nor is it really poetically true either. Later he goes even further:\n\n\nPerhaps the only reply that can be made to Hiroshima is to ask question 7.\n\n\nWell, no, I'm sorry, but this isn't good enough. It's all very well to pontificate that ‘reality is often no more than the enthusiastic answer we give to our dreams and nightmares’, but when it comes to the nuclear bombing of tens of thousands of people, facts matter, and there is in some sense an intellectual duty to recognise what is real and what isn't.\n\nStill, in the end, this uneasiness I felt only represents one failing in a book chock-full of successes – a lone misfire in a box of intellectual fireworks. Maybe if I trusted Flanagan more, I would have gone along with it more enthusiastically, but I still often have the sense that he is writing sentences which have the shape of something profound without all the substance.\n\nAll the same, there are so many strange and wonderful connections here – between cultures, languages, and time periods – that you can't help but come out of it feeling completely energised.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "A splendid and extraordinary book; one that touched my heart in many ways. It is uncategorizable, part memoir and part history, enhanced with a dollop of autofiction. In brilliant prose, Flanagan addresses some of the most significant themes of the 19th and 20th centuries, while painting loving portraits of his homeland and his parents.\n\nThese are the key elements of the book: Flanagan was born on Tasmania. His father was a slave labor POW in Japan during WWII. H.G. Wells had an intense relationship with Rebecca West. In the 1930's, physicist Leo Szilard developed the idea for nuclear chain reactions. And when he was 21, Flanagan almost died in a kayaking accident.\n\nFrom these seemingly unrelated facts, Flanagan creates a tribute to Tasmania, sharing his love for the place and also his pain when reflecting on its conflict past, the genocide of its indigenous population, and the destruction of its rainforests. In parallel, he shares deeply loving descriptions of his hardworking parents, different from one another but both representative of Tasmania, witnesses to the changes to the country over the course of the 20th century.\n\nThe book captures Flanagan's efforts to understand his place in the world he inherited from them. \"Experience is but a moment. Making sense of that moment is a life.\" He has done this so effectively that it is unsurprising that he previously won the Booker for fiction and now the Baillie Gifford prize for non-fiction.\n\nHis message, and the incomparable way in which he expresses it, have affected me profoundly. Not just the sense of a well-told story, but a deeper connection to the beauty and terror of the world we inhabit. This may sound melodramatic, but the truth is that my eyes are filling with tears as I type this. Obviously it won't affect everyone the same way but for me reading it was a remarkable experience.\n\nOh yes, about Question 7 of the title. It is taken from this Chekhov parody of a typical examination question:\n\n\"Wednesday, June 17, 1881, a train had to leave station A at 3am in order to reach station B at 11pm; just as the train was about to depart, however, an order came that the train had to reach station B by 7pm. Who loves longer, a man or a woman?\"\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "As someone who has read all of Flanagan's earlier books, I was initially a little puzzled by this one. It seemed to be retracing previous ground. He had dealt with his near-death experience when he almost drowned in the Franklin River in fictional form in Death of a River Guide (1994), where the death of the titular character forms the frame for rest of the novel. His Booker Prize winner, The Narrow Road to the Deep North (2013) was clearly both inspired and informed by the experiences of his father Arch as a POW and slave labourer in Burma and Japan. And he drew on his experience of the death of his mother Helen in The Living Sea of Waking Dreams (2021). So I wondered why he decided to return to examine all three of these elements in his life in this memoir. But more puzzling were the other focuses of the book. What did Chekov's short stories, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the life of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard and the love affair between H.G. Wells and Rebecca West have to do with Flanagan's biography?\n\nBut I knew how Flanagan can weave a story, so I trusted he would bring these seemingly totally unconnected elements together. And he does. The result is a deeply thoughtful, lyrical, often raw and profoundly wise meditation on life, death and love.\n\nThe connections between the elements I initially found odd and how they relate to the lives of Flanagan and his parents and their respective deaths comes slowly into view and is finally fully interwoven in the ninth chapter. In an age of bestselling lowbrow celebrity autobiographies, this is genuine philosophical memoir and a mature writer mustering his powers at their height to turn and confront some grim and painful aspects of his life that he had previously kept at bay though the distance of fictional treatment. The climax of this is the final section, which gives a detailed, harrowing and genuinely terrifying account of his near-drowning as a young man. This is something he tells us he had previously never fully confronted and the catharsis of his writing makes the impact of this ending to the book all the more moving.\n\nI once wrote a short (affectionate) parody of Flanagan's fiction, which featured a bloke seeing visions of drunken possums and wallabies in a Hobart pub and then going outside to die in the rain. Some of his fiction can come across as very grim and often melancholic. This is quite a contrast to seeing or hearing the author speak or give interviews, where his gentle, wry and self-effacing good humour is very clear; Flanagan, in person, is very funny. Perhaps it's because I listened to the audio book of Question 7 (read by the author himself) while on a series of long drives, but that kindly humour shines through far more clearly in this work.\n\nThe result of this combination of humour, erudition, meditation, perspective and raw honesty is, in the end, genuine wisdom. I hope we get many more books from Richard Flanagan, but this one will certainly remain one of his very best.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "This memoir is about all the chain reactions and circles of life, how one event leads to another event and back. It’s about Richard Flanagan’s mother and father, and family. It’s about Tasmania and history and genocide and convicts and nature and all those influences. It’s also about his father’s experience as a prisoner of the Japanese, as a slave worker in a coal mine in Japan when the bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. If that hadn’t happened his father would probably have died in Japan and so he’d never have been born. So the memoir goes back to HG Wells and his relationship with Rebecca West and the writing of the book The World Set Free and his imagined invention the atomic bomb. There’s much more about the scientific developments as it’s such a major event and the scientists involved, mainly Leo Szilard. The book finishes with Flanagan’s near death experience in the Franklin River.\nThis is beautifully written and I found it incredibly hard to put down. I enjoyed reading about his experiences at Oxford for instance. The stories about his family are moving and heartfelt. I loved it.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Winner of the Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction, worthily so and great to see a novel winning that prize.\n\nAnd so, once more, a disappointing reality was reinvented as a fiction that metamorphosed into an unexpected new reality.\n\nQuestion 7 is the fifth of Richard Flanagan's books I've read, and confirms him as a fascinating, if inconsistent, author - the other four being:\n\nGould's Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish - fascinating in literary terms and a physically beautiful work which, with its use of different coloured inks, has clear echoes in Nicola Barker’s 2017 Goldsmiths Prize winning H(A)PPY;\n\nThe Narrow Road to the Deep North - overly safe and conventional (and did you know he finished it the day his father died - surprised he didn't mention that in any interviews);\n\nFirst Person - a very creative work, one where Flanagan perhaps used the device of his story to settle a few too many scores and drag in a little too much personal history; and\n\nThe Living Sea of Waking Dreams - \"One of the most spectacularly incoherent novels ever to reach print\" to quote Brian Stableford on Bram Stoker’s Lair of the White Worm, but deliberately so and in a so-bad-its-good way.\n\nNaturally the Booker chose to reward much the least ambitious of these, The Narrow Road to the Deep North being one of the weaker winners of the prize. But with Question 7, this year's jury have a chance to make a bolder decision and recognise this hybrid work as the novel, if a novel with little fiction, which I think it is. Flanagan himself teases as the nature of the work in one of his epigraphs which quotes a review of Moby Dick: The author has not given his effort here the benefit of knowing whether it is history, autobiography, gazetteer, tragedy, romance, almanac, melodrama, or fantasy. It may be myriad, it may not. The question is put, but where is the answer?\n\nIndeed Question 7 as a novel is an exemplar of what Javier Cercas, in Anne McLean's translation, described in The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel:\n\nThe novel is not the genre of answers, but that of questions: writing a novel consists of posing a complex question in order to formulate it in the most complex way possible, not to answer it, or not to answer it in a clear and unequivocal way; it consists of immersing oneself in an enigma to render it insoluble, not to decipher it (unless rendering it insoluble is, precisely, the only way to decipher it). That enigma is the blind spot, and the best things these novels have to say they say by way of it: by way of that silence bursting with meaning, that visionary blindness, that radiant darkness, that ambiguity without solution. That blind spot is what we are.\n\n\nAnd Flanagan's question is Question 7 as posed by Chekhov in the story Questions Posed by a Mad Mathematician as translated by Peter Constantine:\n\n7. Wednesday, June 17, 1881, a train had to leave station A at 3am in order to reach station B at 11pm.; just as the train was about to depart, however, an order came from that the train had to reach station B by 7pm. Who loves longer, a man or a woman?\n\n\nHis lack of an answer traces a path from the the near successful genocide of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population, through to the novels of H.G. Wells and his love affair with Rebecca West, through to Leo Szilard, the Manhatten Project and the bomb that ends the war before the PoW camps in Japan could end Flanagan's father's life:\n\nWe cannot be what we cannot dream. And sometimes we discover that we live in the dreams and nightmares of others and we dream anew. I only write this book that you are now reading, no more than a love note to my parents and my island home, a world that has vanished, because over a century ago another writer wrote a book that decades later seized another mind with such force that it became a reality that reshaped the world. It was a story of horror that was his fear of love, complete love without measure or boundary, and he created in its place an idea of destruction without limit. In this way, the world begat a book that would in turn beget the world.\n\nWithout Rebecca West’s kiss H. G. Wells would not have run off to Switzerland to write a book in which everything burns, and without H. G. Wells’s book Leo Szilard would never have conceived of a nuclear chain reaction and without conceiving of a nuclear chain reaction he would never have grown terrified and without growing terrified Leo Szilard would never have persuaded Einstein to lobby Roosevelt and without Einstein lobbying Roosevelt there would have no Manhattan Project and without the Manhattan Project there is no lever at 8.15 am on 6 August 1945 for Thomas Ferebee to release 31,000 feet over Hiroshima, there is no bomb on Hiroshima and no bomb on Nagasaki and 100,000 people or 160,000 people or 200,000 people live and my father dies. Poetry may make nothing happen, but a novel destroyed Hiroshima and without Hiroshima there is no me and these words erase themselves and me with them.\n\nBut that is to imply a linear causuality that is the opposite of what Flanagan wishes to suggest. He acknowledges the influence of this essay by Siena Stubbs, which suggests a fourth tense in Yolŋu:\n\n\nIt’s what is happening now. This has always happened, is happening and will happen in the future. Yolŋu people have always sat/are sitting/will always sit under the shaded resting place named Buṉumbirr at this place and were thinking/are thinking/will think about the fish that they will catch later in the day.\n\nListen to the sound of Bunbuyŋu Miyarama (the ancestors’ voices) …\nthe sound of the Miliwurrwurr (Rirratjiŋu clan) people talking…\nanticipating the sweet taste of the fish.\n\nThe past is in the present is in the future. Our ancestors were here, are here and will be here, waiting for the tide to go out so the fish can be caught. Yambirrpa has always provided fish for Yolŋu people and it will continue to.\n\n\nAnd as Flanagan concludes on the morality or otherwise of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan:\n\nWhat if vengeance and atonement both are simply the lie that time can be reversed, and thereby some equality, some equilibrium, some justice had? Is it simply truer to say Hiroshima happened, Hiroshima is still happening, and Hiroshima will always happen?\n\nA brilliantly conceived work. There's a lot packed in to its relatively modest page count, and some elements will work better or less well for different readers - for me the role of HG Wells in the chain reaction of events most fascinating, although other parts of the Manhatten Project very well trodden territory, the political discussions on Tasmanian and the role of the Martians (the English) most thought provoking, and the family memoir skippable (hence the 4 not 5 stars).\n\nTo end with a fascinating fact of my own, not in the novel. H G Wells visited Australia in late 1938 / early 1939. The then Australian PM, I believe the only Tasmanin to ever hold the post, criticised him for his speeches there as he has “so far indulged his well-known political sympathies as to make disparaging remarks about the leaders of other nations”. Those leaders about which Wells was so rude … Hitler and Mussolini. And of course the PM himself was largely echoing the appeasement policy that still prevailed in the UK, a policy some might argue that was all about preservation of the colonies.\n\nThanks to the publisher via Netgalley for the ARC.\nShow more",

I only write this book you are now reading, no more than a love note to my parents and my island home, a world that has vanished, because over a century ago another writer wrote a book with such a force that it became a reality that reshaped the world.\"\n\n\nQuestion 7 para mí funciona como un combo con \"El mar vivo de los sueños despiertos\", o como un complemento, porque ya en su momento cuando a principios de año la leí, aunque claramente es una novela, sí que tuve la impresión de que había mucho de autoficción en ella, o que de alguna forma Flanagan exorcizaba en ella, quizás la muerte de su madre o de su padre y estaba hablando incluso de sí mismo, es tanta la verdad que translucía ese texto. Es una impresión, que se me ha confirmado con Question 7, que tal como él dice en esta primera cita convierte en una carta de amor a sus padres y a Tasmania, pero su habilidad está quizás no tanto en la historia en sí sino en la forma en que consigue traspasar y conectar: \"And so at the beginning I learnt this: the words of a book are never the book, the soul of it is everything\". \"El mar vivo de los sueños despiertos\" me tocó porque la sentí muy cercana e igual me he sentido con esta Question 7: doscientas y pico páginas que son una mezcla de memoria personal y famliar, filosofía personal, biografía, historia novelizada y reflexión sobre la creación artistica. Los textos de Flanagan me parecen siempre muy verdaderos, muy cercanos e íntimos, consiguen conmoverme hasta el punto de que me veo identificada y retratada en muchos momentos: “Its in fragments that we find ourselves”. En Question 7, por ejemplo, son especialmente conmovedores los momentos en los que Flanagan habla de sus padres, se retrotrae a experiencias familiares del pasado y los enfrenta a la visión que tiene de ellos cuando ya se han hecho mayores, los convierte en momentos tan íntimos como universales. Es de los pocos autores ahora mismo que se ve muy verdadero y personal, y esto es quizás debido a este estilo tan práctico y poético al mismo tiempo.\n\n\n\"And when she was leaving we somehow ended up sitting in her car and she spoke of how difficult our father was, how since his retirement he would sort out her cupboards and drawers expressing dissatisfaction with the way she kept them. Her cupboards and drawers, her smallest of dominions and one of the few allowed to her. And she began to cry, there on the street, sitting in her car, my tough old mum, crying, her large hands all the time grasping the steering wheel, as though there was still some turning down the road that she might yet take..\"\n\n\nSe puede decir que en Question 7 hay varios hilos conductores, varias lineas argumentales que se entrelazan, confluyen, se alejan y vuelven a conectar en una demostración de ese concepto de que todo está relacionado. Por resumirlo de alguna forma, estos hilos que guían al lector serán tres o cuatro:\n\n\n\"Sometimes I wonder why we keep returning to beginnings -why we seek the single thread we might pull to unravel the tapestry we call our life in the hope that behind it we will find the truth of why.\nBut there is no truth. There's is only why. And when we look closer we see that behind that why is just another tapestry.\nAnd behind it another, and another, until we arrive at oblivion.\"\n\n\n- Por una parte tendremos la linea en torno a la familia Flanagan que vive en Tasmania, sus padres y él mismo profundamente marcado por un padre que fue prisionero de guerra de los japoneses y que participó en la construcción del ferrocarril de la muerte, un tema que Flanagan ya exploraba en su novela “El camino estrecho al norte profundo” que no he leído todavía. Sin embargo, aquí en Question 7, Flanagan no lo noveliza, sino que se aproxima desde el punto de vista de un niño que siempre detectó la profunda huella que aquella experiencia había dejado en su padre, aunque sin encontrar explicación a un cierto comportamiento de un padre que buscaba siempre la soledad, porque su padre nunca habló de su profundo dolor aunque Flanagan ya como adulto indagó en él. Esta experiencia como prisionero/esclavo de guerra también marcará al hijo que ya de adulto recorrerá los mismos lugares e incluso llegará a encontrarse con personas que vivieron la misma experiencia de su padre para llegar a entender ese trauma. Flanagan lo cuenta a flor de piel, pero las mejores páginas de este texto serán aquellos en los nos contará como son ellos, sus padres ya en su vejez.\n\n\n\"It was clear to me even when I was very young that my father was different, that he had passed through something, but what that something was wasn't really talked about. A quiet and reserved man who neither disciplned me nor encouraged me nor damned me nor praised me, he was for the most part vaporous, there and not there, substance and non-substance.\n\nHe saw the world aslant. It was for him a great tragicomedy in which the comedy was mad poignant by the tragedy and the tragedy rendered bearable by the comedy. When the subject was sad or serious, he would smile wanly, his face turning inside out, a concertina of wrinkles compressing his eyes into wry sunken currants, and from him would flow a riversong of stories.\"\n\n\n- Otra de las lineas argumental hace referencia a la colonización de Tasmania, esa colonización europea sobre los aborígenes de Tasmania que marcaron un genoicidio en sí mismo y que Flanagan conectará con su propia familia y con sus posible sangre aborígen.\n\n\n\"Is It because we see our world only darkly that we surround ourselves with líes we call time, history, reality, memory, detail, facts?\"\n\n\n- Y en el tercer hilo argumental, que podría haber sido el primero, Flanagan hace surgir a HG Wells a través de su novela The world set free conectándola con la historia de Hiroshima, ya que en esta novela en la que todo estalla, Wells predice la guerra nuclear años antes de que siquiera comenzaran las investigaciones hablando de un arma destructiva que lo arrasaría todo a su paso. ¿Y cómo decide Flanagan conectar la historia de Hiroshima, que le interesa contar porque además estará intimamente relacionada con la experiencia de su padre con la del escritor HG Wells? Pues usará el encuentro entre HG Wells y Rebecca West, como momento de inflexión, lo conectados que se sintieron desde el primer momento, pero de quién en un principio Wells huyó: \"Meanwhile, Rebecca West was writing of how she could'nt conceive of a person who ran about lighting bonfires but feared the flame. Yet that was HG Wells. But he did not want someone like her, who burnt.\" El momento justo, imagino que totalmente novelizado dentro de la historia real, en el que Wells besa a Rebecca West frente al escaparate de una librería, será el momento decisivo que hará surgir la novela que luego escribiría. Tras el beso a Rebecca West, Wells, hombre casado, huye aterrado a refugiarse en los Alpes suizos a escribir la novela The world set free. Igual sin este beso/huida a Suiza escapando del terror que le producía enamorarse de la escritora, nunca se habría escrito este libro que predijo el cataclismo de la bomba atómica. “Fiction may be only fancy yet reality is often no more than the enthusiastic answer we give to our deams and nightmares.” La realidad no deja de ser un espejo surgida de la ficción, de nuestros sueños y pesadillas...\n\n\n“They should never have met, they were destined for each other, he would make her life and destroy her life and she would make her life in spite of his life, he would be an inexhaustible source of love and friendship for her for the next 35 years, he would madden her, he would win her and lose her and win her, she would be the one person he cared to see to the end.\n\nRebecca West and HG Wells were completely wrong for each other, they were completely right; she saw he wouldn't leave his wife, he saw he needed a wife. He thought love was just common sense, she thought it was a way of losing It, he was for sex without love, she was for the whole damn business. He believed he was reinventing literature as a form of proselytising journalism, while she wrote many years after their affaire ended, as still arguing with him, that art was not a plaything, but a necessity, and the book she wrote , Black Lamb Grey Falcon, reinvented journalism as literature, prefiguring much of what literature would become.\n\nShe discovered very early that her chief strenght as a writer was that she wrote as she felt whereas most writers only write as others think. Along with her new name she stole from Ibsen the thoroughly non English idea that ideas make the world spin around...\"\n\n\nRichard Flanagan usa técnicas novelescas para vincular a Wells con su amante y futura pareja, Rebecca West, y con Lee Szilard, cuya lectura de la novela de Wells le hizo ser el primero en darse cuenta de que el poder nuclear podía usarse para hacer una bomba de proporciones aterradoras, la reacción nuclear en cadena, y esta idea se convertirá en un concepto recurrente a lo largo de toda esta obra, así que la novela de Wells será el punto inicial que marcará el comienzo de Hiroshima. Todo está conectado, interrelacionado y una cosa siempre llevará a la otra. De la misma manera que en que está conectado el mundo, así Flanagan conectará Tasmania y el genocidio de los aborígenes, con el internamiento de su padre en los durísimos campos de prisioneros de guerra en el sudeste asiático construyendo una reflexión muy personal, poética y muy lúcida sobre la vida, la memoria, sus ancestros, la huella que la violencia y los traumas dejarán en nosotros: \"Does time heal? Time does not always heal. Time scars.\" Reconozco en Richard Flanagan un escritor único, que no se parece a nadie y el modo en que explora los momentos más duros y devastadores de la humanidad mimetizándolos con los personales igual de traumáticos, están exponiendo claramente que cuando algo ocurre, no solo se ha convertido en parte del pasado sino que sigue siendo parte de nuestro futuro, nada desaparece: la necesidad de olvidar es tan fuerte como la necesidad de recordar, incluso más poderosa...\n\n\n\"As if the need to forget is as strong as the need to remember. Perhaps stronger.\n\nAnd after oblivion? We return to the stories we call our memories, perplexed, strangers to the ongoing invention that is our life.\"\n\n\nEl titulo de esta obra proviene de un cuento de Chéjov, “Pregunta de un matemático loco”, una especie de parodia de un problema de matemáticas escolar. La pregunta 7 es: El miércoles 17 de junio de 1881, un tren tenía que salir de la estación A a las 3 de la mañana para llegar a la estación B a las 11 de la noche; sin embargo, justo cuando el tren estaba a punto de partir, llegó una orden de que el tren debía llegar a la estación B a las 7 de la tarde. ¿Quién ama más, un hombre o una mujer?\n\n\n¿Quién ama más? Será una pregunta recurrente a lo largo de esta obra. Chéjov/Flanagan nos está enfrentando al hecho de no detenernos en lo superficial y mirar más allá de la lógica y la racionalidad de este mundo porque su lógica siempre va a resultar imprevista y surgirá otro nivel que no sabíamos que existía y que probablemente sea la auténtica realidad aunque no la percibamos a simple vista porque vivimos en un mundo de apariencias y existe esa otra realidad que es la de verdad pero que no vemos. Una pregunta sin respuesta, pero Chéjov creía que el papel de la literatura no era dar respuestas sino plantear preguntas necesarias, solo los tontos creen tener las respuestas. Se puede decir que hay otra linea argumental más soterrada y escondida que habla de los ancestros donde Flanagan se detiene en el concepto del tiempo, todo tiempo puede coexistir, los antepasados que estuvieron aquí, seguirán estando aquí: “Life is always happening and has happened and will happen…”. En definitiva, un texto absolutamente devastador, lúcido, y conmovedor. Eso sí, yo lo leería como una extensión de “El mar vivo de los sueños despiertos”\n\n\n“Perhaps the only reply that can be made to Hiroshima is to ask question 7. If it is a question that can never be answered, it is still the question we must keep asking, if only in order to understand that life is never binary, nor reducible to cant or code, but a mystery we must aprehend. In Chekhovs stories, the only fools are those with answers.\n\n\"Chekhov wrote question 7 is about how the world from which we presume to derive meaning and purpose is not the true world. It is a surface world, a superficial world, a frozen world of appearances, beneath which an entirely different world surges as if a wild river that any moment might drown us.\"\n\n♫♫♫ Bright Horses - Nick Cave ♫♫♫\nShow more"

I’m incredibly disappointed that I didn’t enjoy this latest read. I wanted to leave having gained greater understanding of how to untangle emotions, but felt it just barely hit the surface of emotions and advice we’re always given (I.e. “it’s okay to feel emotions”). Some of the illustrations were used in prior books and felt cringy, even though I’m sure she got permission from family/friends to use them. I wanted depth like her previous reads and didn’t feel that connection. Thank you Netgalley for the Advanced copy in exchange for an honest review.\nShow more",

        "Review 3": "I'd like to start my review by saying that I think Allen's heart for this topic is so important. The American church has been known to belittle or even vilify emotions to a non-biblical extent. I'm rating this book 3 stars because I don't think there was anything inherently wrong in it. (Although I didn't love the use of the word \"joy\" as a starting point for all positive emotions but... semantics.)\n\nUnfortunately I found this book promising lots and delivering little. I kept waiting for new revelations from the content, but it all felt very basic. There was also little scripture to be found for the points that were made. While I agreed with a lot of what she said, I can not think of a new concept I learned or new perspective I was shown.\n\nThere were multiple times in this book that Jennie mentions wishing she should have a cup of coffee with the reader to hear their story in relation to the topic at hand. With this, I think she illustrates the problem I had with this book, that it is too broad and surface-level to invite much conversation or deep thought. Overall, I think it would have made a much better podcast subject or long-form essay.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC of this book.

I loved the episodes with Jennie so much, and I'm glad I didn't skip reading this life-changing, super practical, and biblically supported bomb of a book.\nIt was such a journey reading this with my Mom. We were both balling our eyes out (especially in the beginning), and I was so wowed by the relatability and perspective she brought to this. As someone (like most people) with trauma, this was so eye opening as Jennie outlined how our emotions are connectors to God and one another, and how each emotion is a unique way to let God work in us. We always have a choice in what we do with all of our emotions, and they are not sins in and of themselves unless we act on them negatively. It's no joke that this book has seriously changed my life, my relationship with God, and my relationships with my family. Lots of note taking commenced while reading, which is generally not something I do unless it's THAT GOOD. I highly highly highly recommend reading this: it couldn't be more timely or well-needed for the times we find ourselves in and in a society so overwhelmed and inundated with mental health crises and so many voices on what to do with it all. Jennie goes to the Bible with candid truth and practical advice. This filled my soul and grew my spiritual muscles a million-fold.

I would highly recommend this book to everyone!",

Jennie’s writing is a conversational style, and she details how to feel your emotions instead of avoiding them. This would be a good book for someone who is just starting to dive into this, but for myself it felt a little too beginner compared to her other books. I would still recommend this one but in the future would like to see books from her that are a little deeper!\n\nThanks to NetGalley for the ARC.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Honestly…I felt like this lacked depth. I’m more of a feeler, and I feel like this was maybe geared more towards people who don’t feel enough, so maybe that’s why I just didn’t get as much out of it?\n\nI think that her steps were pretty solid and there wasn’t anything glaringly unhelpful. I certainly felt encouraged and reminded of Biblical truths about emotions, but most of the time I felt like it was pretty shallow and lacked meat for an entire book.\n\nYou might love it! Just didn’t do it for me.\nShow more",

        "Review 1": "Yes, But Who Am I?\n\n“Whiskey Tender” is Deborah Jackson Taffa’s search for her identity as a mixed tribe native girl. Her father is Quechan/Laguna, and her mother is a devout Hispanic Catholic. This is not a story of a girl soaking in the stories handed down by her family, she had to fight through their reluctance to speak of the things they had endured: tales of the treatment suffered in the Indian residential boarding schools and, as she said, “...the shame: the silence that follows an apocalypse.”\n\nIn addition to the struggles for support within the family, her identity was beset by social confusion. Born on the Yuma, California Reservation, the family moved to Farmington, New Mexico, where her father could find the work he was trained for. Leaving the reservation was tantamount to betrayal or desertion in the eyes of her father’s people. Farmington is on the northeast border of the Navajo Nation and there was a resistance against full acceptance of Quechan blood and tradition. The Hispanic population did not see Deborah’s family as their own, either. As for the white attitude, Farmington had just been the scene of protests following the “Indian rolling” kidnapping and murdering of three native men by three high school students.\n\nThis confusing attempt to grasp identity while being sent mixed signals reminded me of “If I Survive You” by Jonathan Escoffery, a novel shortlisted for the 2023 Booker Prize. A main theme of that book involves the denial of acceptance by those the protagonist is drawn to. Escoffery’s character is a young Jamaican immigrant, rejected by Jamaican islanders just as soundly as he is rejected by every other group in his new home.\n\nThis is a fascinating portrait of where Native Americans look to find themselves today, told through one woman’s coming of age in an America which has tried so hard to whitewash out her heritage. I love the relationship she conveys with her father. I am touched by the distance she and her mother try so hard to bridge. A wonderful book addressing life from the family to the nation.\n\nThank you to Harper Books and NetGalley for providing an advance reader copy in exchange for an honest review. #WhiskeyTender #NetGalley\n\n***Acknowledged by author on X / Twitter...\nDeborah Jackson Taffa\n@deborahtaffa\nThanks for the dream comparison to\n@J_Escoffery\n, Michael!

        "Review 2": "Interesting meditations from a Native American memoirist and writer about retaining one’s heritage culture while facing pressures to assimilate to the dominant group. Deborah Jackson Taffa writes with unfiltered honesty about the sometimes complicated and sometimes simple dynamics of her family, the white supremacist violence faced by members of the Native community, and her own coming of age amidst different cultural and social factors. While the writing in this memoir sometimes felt a bit slow or uneven to me, I recognize this book’s importance within the broader literary canon.\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "Everyone should read this book. Or listen to it, as I did. The narrator did such a fantastic job bringing the story to life, I adored her narration. I know she's also in Wandering Stars which is one of my next listens and another few books on my tbr. I can't wait to hear more from her.\n\nIn Whiskey Tender we follow Deborah, as she grows up, not really sure where she belongs. We get to know her, her family, her tribal traditions and even learn some history along the way.\n\nI was already familiar with the history, but I love that it was included. Especially in such a skillful way where it compliments the story instead of being a \"random\" block of historical text in the middle of storytelling.\n\nWhat I never really thought about, is that a tribe may not have many traditions or know about them, and how that might feel for members of said tribe. Taffa tackles that in the book very well.\n\nAlso, seeing how she was treated for not being a part of the dominant tribe in the area, or being native in general was very eye opening.\n\nAgreeing with everyone who said this should be in school (and all) libraries. It's simply a must read.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Rounding up to four. I probably should’ve read this in pieces. It was a lot of trauma to read through in one sitting. It was an important story to read, and I suspect that it’s a very common one among the Indigenous, especially because colonizing the Americas was not a one time event, that there are other forms of more insidious and legalized genocides occurring still, and because it happened/is still happening on every continent. On top of that, the Indigenous people of today are still suffering from the generational trauma they’ve been inheriting ever since and will continue to pass down, because even if they ever find their way out of disenfranchisement, there is so much damage to work through. It would take maybe two or three times as long to undo and rebuild any semblance of health and peace at any level. Until then, we have to make a collective effort to make sure their stories are never forgotten, even as they are actively being erased from US textbooks today (thanks to MAGA denial of facts).\nShow more",
        "Review 5": "(Note: I received an advanced reader copy of this book courtesy of NetGalley)\n\nI honestly don’t know where to start on everything that I was able to learn thanks to Deborah Tafa’s personal narrative and the way that it seamlessly blends her personal story and family history with plentiful amounts of general Native American history and Native American history pertaining specifically to the American southwest. Whisky Tender ended up providing quite the hefty education that I immediately valued immensely, speaking as someone whose own education about indigenous Americans wasn’t so much an education as it was a nearly total lack of one. I appreciated the way that Taffa managed to expose my now-glaring knowledge gaps on numerous indigenous-related matters that I wasn’t even aware of before promptly proceeding to give me a helpful foundation to filling them in.\n\nHowever, even if by some miracle I had been able to go into this book already completely up to date on the aforementioned, I would have treasured reading it all the same. It’s a beautifully honest and open memoir about growing up and trying to navigate the sharp disconnect between a white-centric mainstream culture, the so-called American dream and her own native identity. Also, speaking as a descendant of European settlers and immigrants - the country as Taffa has lived it and as I have lived it so far have been extremely different experiences (and that’s such an understatement that it almost feels like a crime), and it’s not often that I get the valuable opportunity to get at least a glimpse into this part of America, much less one so very deeply intimate.\n\nWhisky Tender is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2023, and one of my favorite reads of the year in general - and in my opinion, it’s now an absolute must-have for the shelves of my local public library and the academic library where I work.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "It's always strange to rate a memoir, when it's basically about someone's life and memories, right? But thankfully, I really liked this and got emotional a few times. It only covers Jackson Taffa's childhood and teenage years, so I would call it a coming-of-age memoir. It's deeply concerned with roots and the trauma and twisting of living in a majority culture that's white (supermacist), catholic, capitalist.\n\nA lot of tragedy is depicted in the book (quite a lot of tragedy for a book that covers 18 or so years of life), but I have to admit that the moments that got to me most where the small ones, the little losses, the little victories of the system over the author. Like the relationship with one of the catholic nun / teachers at school and how Deborah Jackson Taffa really wanted her academic approval. The moments where I was feeling it more deeply were also the ones where she started to rebel and give herself agency in the world, instead of (understandably) trying so hard to fit into the majority culture.\n\nJackson Taffa, as a child and teenager, is constantly pulled in different directions, trying to connect to her Indigenous roots via her father and other Indigenous people around, but also trying to live with her own mother, Mexican and catholic, who wants her children to share in her religion and also pass as white. The complexity of this situation was realy well-rendered in the book and lead to plenty of painful, but also joyful moments.\n\nOnce again, weird to say this about a memoir, but at times I felt the pacing was a bit off, or too slow, or too detailed. And I couldn't connect to the book as deeply as I would have liked. Still, a really great story about the emptiness of the genocidal American Dream, figuring that out, and then forging your own path ahead.\n\n20/31 reads in 31 days in January.\nShow more",
        "Review 7": "Deborah Taffa’s gorgeous memoir “Whiskey Tender” brims with life. And death. And dreams.\n\nIcama, as Taffa explains early in the book, is a core belief of the Quechuan people in Southwest America. It is a respect and belief that one’s dreams can act as a guide towards civic responsibility, personal goals, spiritual power, as well as an interaction with the souls of the dead.\n\nAt the beginning of Part 1, Taffa sets up the present context of being fifty years old and driving with her father to her mother’s funeral and falling “into a sandstorm dream.” They are going home to their reservation in Yuma, CA, where Taffa and her family lived during her early childhood. As I read, I too feel into the dream of the book, the characters came alive as they protected and pulled away from each other; as the journeys towards and away from home were immersion in cultures, neighborhoods, towns and their ancient and urban ways; as dreams weaved in and out of a physical and material reality that invited me in and stunned me with its vividness. Life and death intertwine and sadness looms and envelopes. Full of specificity and immediacy, the book is about family, colonialism, the extractionary harshness of whiteness, the struggle of communities to stay together and not knowing what helps or hinders that togetherness. Overall, there is no turning away from the wrenching realities of living on and away from a family’s ancestral land.\n\nThis is a coming of age memoir spanning the time from Taffa’s birth to her graduating from high school in Farmington, NM in the 1980s. Her father is Quechan/Laguna and her mother is Hispanic; and both of them come from families with deep roots in New Mexico. Taffa is a magical storyteller. She resurrects, for the reader, the large families on both sides—full of siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents that both her parents bring into their union. There are differences in religious practices, although Taffa’s paternal grandmother who held a mixture of tribal and Christian beliefs gives an insight into how they can be merged into a spiritual life. As she grows, Taffa encounters and confronts spaces and individuals where religion plays a central role. She goes to a convent school where nuns and other teachers hold on to the punitive power of Christianity over the native communities. As a child, she attends a funeral after the early and tragic death of her uncle and aunt where the ceremony in the Cry House and the cremation of bodies over the cottonwood branches reminded me of my own family’s Hindu practice of mourning. Taffa’s mother is a devout Catholic who says the rosary and takes her little girls to mass every morning but also ignores the wisdom of the native ways that Taffa seeks out.\n\nTaffa’s father is a mighty presence in the book. Taffa is honest and clear about his difficult beginnings and his run-ins with the law and time in jail when he was a teenager. As the book progresses, he trains to be a welder, gets a stable job at the Four Corners power plant, and becomes the first Indian foreman in the history of the plant. He coaches softball when Taffa and her siblings are younger, exposes the kids to contemporary culture, tells them stories of growing up rough on the Yuma reservation, and as she grows, encourages Taffa to make her own choices and to figure out what it means for her to be an individual. He is sharp, tough, and grounded but also kind and supportive.\n\nThroughout, we see the Southwest landscape through Taffa’s eyes – the Colorado river that runs through the Yuma reservation, the Animas river where her family goes fishing, the cacti and sage plants, the sandstone lands and the desert canyons, the ravens and eagles, juniper and cottonwood trees, the sun rising over the bluffs and boulders. As a teenager, she gets up early and hikes in her favorite canyon by herself. I loved to imagine her walking and thinking about all that she was beginning to confront in her young life. In addition to the angst most youngsters feel, Taffa has a lot coming at her from different directions – a deep longing to learn from her ancestors and to help with the Quechan community, a need for friendship with native people her age, a desire to puzzle out the intersections of history and country, a wrestling with how she could speak up about injustice.\n\nLate in the book, Taffa has a dream while driving back home with her family, after her sister survives a terrible car accident. She writes about the dream: “...my ancestors were running across the desert. They were leaping over washes and climbing up boulders with supernatural speed—and they were pulling me alongside them. At first I thought we were trying to escape, but then I realized we were running toward rather than away, and the dream became beautiful.”\nShow more",
        "Review 8": "An honest exploration of identity, Whiskey Tender pulled on my heartstrings as an Indigenous/Mexican woman. While Taffa’s stories weren’t fully relatable to me, they made me long for the loss of my culture as I was raised to “fit in” to White American.",
        "Review 9": "5 stars. Excellent.",
        "Review 10": "I am so grateful to Deborah Taffa for gifting us with Whiskey Tender and her life story. Taffa is my age, and yet her formative years were so different from my own - growing up \"half-breed\" with grandparents who were born to the Quechan Nation and Laguna Pueblo tribe, a mother who was raised Catholic, and a father raised in the Native American traditions. From the perspective of a girl growing up among so many different worlds, Taffa explores the difficult issues of reconciliation, assimilation, segregation and tradition. This memoir is educative and evocative and an important addition to an ugly (and still unresolved) chapter of American history.\nShow more"

        "Review 1": "as i made my way through this book, i felt an irrevocable sense of despair for everything that has been lost and continues to be lost- both Palestinian lives and the world’s collective humanity as it allows this to continue.\n\nThe account of events in this book is indeed a very short history, but you don’t need more than that in the first instance to identify Israel for what it is- a ruthless settler-colonial project.\n\nThere is no excuse for ignorance.\n\nWe owe it to our humanity to read about a genocide that started before most of our lifetimes yet continues to unfold in front of our very eyes today.\nShow more",
        "Review 2": "​| 3/5 Stars | ★★★☆☆\n\nTrigger Warnings for A Very Short History of the Israel-Palestine Conflict: \nViolence, War, Death, Ethnic Cleansing, Genocide, Displacement, Colonialism, Oppression, Political Conflict, Trauma, Human Rights Violations\n\nA Very Short History of the Israel-Palestine Conflict​ is a short nonfiction book by Ilan Pappé. This book takes us back to 1882 and walks us - or should I say, runs us - to the present day Israel-Palestine conflict. Pappé takes particular focus in helping us to understand Palestinian resistance to occupation.\n\nA Very Short History of the Israel-Palestine Conflict is incredibly informative, but woof was it a tough read. It was tough particularly due to both how dry it was and how dense the material is. This felt like reading a textbook and I felt like I was cramming for a test. All of this being said, Pappé really has created an indispensable guide to understanding the Israel-Palestine conflict. As someone who came in without much knowledge and, therefore, no strong feelings, I truly learned so much.\n\nI absolutely recommend A Very Short History of the Israel-Palestine Conflict, with the caveat that you should try to listen to it on audio rather than read the physical version. This was a great book to listen to while doing other things, like cleaning or driving. I don't think it would have held my attention if I had to pick up the physical book.\n\nFollow all of my reviews and content with LinkTree\nShow more",
        "Review 3": "For those who describe this book as \"biased\", have you ever read other books/articles about the conflict? have you ever documented yourself? have you ever considered the possibility western governments aren't always on the correct side?\n\nEurope (and the USA) made so many wrong decisions and now they can't admit they were wrong and their actions have consequences.\n\nEssential reading.\nShow more",
        "Review 4": "Unbelievably biased, one-sided, and full of “facts” that are stated without the full picture. It’s sad that people eat this up. If Israel wanted genocide the war would have been over on October 8th.",
        "Review 5": "Before I bought this book, I realised my knowledge on the Israel-Palestine conflict as well as Hamas and Hezbollah etc was quite limited, so I decided to improve on this.\n\nI wanted a book that provided facts and nothing more, I wanted to come to the conclusions myself, and if that is what you're looking for, do not read this book.\n\nIlan Pappe, the author, unbeknownst to me prior to purchasing this book is known as 'one of the world's sloppiest historians' according to some. He and a few others are known as Israel's New Historians, who have had access to recently declassified documents from the Israeli government.\n\nHowever, despite being an Israeli, he clearly demonstrates Palestinian favouritism. Throughout the book, he is almost always trying to convince you that the Zionists are in the wrong at every stage since they first started Immigrating to what would be known as Israel.\n\nNow, it is hard for me to say whether this is an incorrect point of view, as I'm not knowledgeable enough on the topic (especially after reading this one sided book). But, I will say that reading this book, despite being fairly well written, will not give you the breadth of viewpoints you may be looking for, mostly just the pro-palestinian view.\nShow more",
        "Review 6": "I'm sure it's near impossible to find an unbiased account on the Israel-Palestine conflict. But, there isn't even a shred of sympathy for Israel in this book. Was great to get an account on some of the events from a different point of view. But in virtually every chapter it is 'Palestine are the innocent victims and Israel are the evil colonisers'.",
        "Review 7": "Un testo imprescindibile per chi vuol fare chiarezza sulla storia e non sulle opinioni",
        "Review 8": "I tried to keep an open mind while I read this book, telling myself I needed to hear all sides of the story and understand the history between the ongoing conflict. Unfortunately the historical references were not complete and favored the Palestinians. He described the holocaust as just a historical event and throughout the book demonizes the Israeli people and Jews- even going so far as to not condemning Hamas for the October 8 attacks, but almost justifying it because of the oppression of their people over the last eight decades.\n\nWar sucks. Watching men, women and children suffer is awful and I hate how broken this world is. If Israel had the option of protecting the innocent while taking down the terrorist, I have to believe they would. I don’t have the answers to ending this war, however, Israel has the right to protect themselves and it seems that many of its neighboring countries continue to poke the bear.\nShow more",
        "Review 9": "Give this to any zionist who might somehow, for whatever reason, exist in your life. Tell them they can do it, it’s only 160 pages. I completely understand we can’t hate people just because they are Jews. Of course, that would be dumb. Israelis, Jews and Zionist are separate concepts, One can be one thing without the other and one can be Zionist without being Jews. But what infuriates me is the number of people who quick to blame us racists and use anti semitism movement to excuse every single despicable thing they’ve done. And then there are those who are quick to remind us not to hate on Jews, as if that’s the most urgent issue to address right now? 40,000 people, including babies and children, have been killed. And yet, people are telling us relax. Huh. Get your priorities straight.\nShow more",
