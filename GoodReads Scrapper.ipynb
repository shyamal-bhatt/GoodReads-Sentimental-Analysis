      "{'Review 1': 'I was enthralled with Helen Garner’s quest to connect with her grandson, turning from boy to man, across the season of AFL. The training, the games, the team, and their camaraderie. The OBSERVATION of this. Who better to bear witness than this author, I think I’m quite enamoured by HG. Not at all a worry to be the furthest thing from a footy fan.\\n\\nAsking questions, uncaring if they are simple, inane or something that any fan would already know. I love this about her, it’s what I do. Question, question, question. \"Why does mullet equal footy?\\' Is this not the best?!\\n\\nBeing a neighbour to her kin, this family is lovely to observe. The honesty appealing and welcomed, entirely clear their love is strong and real. Her grandson WANTS to be with her. So often they hang out.\\n\\nI feel old and deaf and awed, in the back seat with the dog.\\n\\nI sense her awareness of ageing, stating, not emoting. I was fully absorbed in the sparseness of writing. A little rush of desolation. It doesn\\'t matter if I\\'m not there. No one needs me. I\\'m not essential after all. I\\'m only a witness. It\\'s one of the sporadic bursts of reality that grandparents have to bear. You\\'re making a serious mistake if you start to think you\\'re near the centre. You\\'re on the periphery. You\\'re a servant. A hanger-on. And soon you\\'ll be dead.\\n\\nFully committed to transporting Amby, soaking in the pre training excitement, a fabulous time to ask questions of her boy.\\n\\nWhere am I going to put myself, with my brand-new notebook hidden in the back pocket of my overalls? Vowing to remain unseen, Amby did comment offhandedly that he didn’t ever notice her presence. A little stab to my heart!\\n\\nHelen is funny, deprecating. I loved it to bits. ..despite his absurd little moustache (they\\'re all growing them-it\\'s a thing in the AFL and even on the streets, for God\\'s sake)..\\n\\nLittle tid bits, and the free-flowing convo between these two. What? They pinch you? Isn\\'t pinching sort of girly? Is it allowed?\\n\\nthe women runners with their whirling ponytails and cold-beamed little head-torches. Some of them are wiry and feet, with the smooth, economical movements of marathon runners; others are plump, with big hips, bellies and breasts..

To reflect on his changes since carrying him around so heavy on the hip, and revel in the joy of it all.

But beyond both is a secret life that baffles us… If it is a question that can never be answered, it is still the question we must keep asking, if only in order to understand that life is never binary, nor reducible to cant or code, but a mystery we at best apprehend. In Chekhov’s stories, the only fools are those with answers.\\n\\nThe question was, What is a structure of atom? And the answer was an atomic bomb…\\nThe question was, How could H. G. Wells write such crap as Marriage? And the answer was a love affair of the author with the critic…\\nRichard Flanagan starts the novel recalling his father…\\n\\nHe saw the world aslant. It was for him a great tragicomedy in which the comedy was made poignant by the tragedy and the tragedy rendered bearable by the comedy.\\n\\nTime flies bringing changes… And in this world we all are time travellers… Living we travel through time with a normal speed…\\n\\nWe will have arrived back on Wells’s time traveller’s dying beach, alone, in a dimming twilight. If I were a sculptor this would be my art: rusting machinery without purpose rising out of oily scum. People might see it as beauty or meaning. But they would be wrong. It would be what remains.\\n\\nSome questions are answered right away… Some questions will never have any answer.\\nShow more', 'Review 2': '‘Experience is but a moment. Making sense of that moment is a life.’\\n\\nIn Richard Flanagan’s own words, this book is ‘no more than a love note to my parents and my island home, a world that has vanished’, but indeed it IS more than that. Part simple memoir, part Labatut-esque lightly fictionalised history that presents a concatenation of events with the bombing of Hiroshima at its centre, and which ultimately results in Flanagan’s own birth.\\n\\nThe simple memoir — the ‘love note’ — is easily the stronger portion of the book for me. It displays a restraint I have not seen before in Flanagan’s work and yet is powerfully emotional. Portraits of his parents, assorted relatives, and a Tasmanian way of life passing out of living memory are rendered with economical clarity — ‘My father remembered how the coming of electric light killed ghost stories’ — while encompassing too, the much more ancient way of life that preceded it: ‘If this book were the forty thousand years (Aboriginal people) have existed on this island, Europeans would enter the story only in the last page and a half.’\\n\\nBraided through this personal memoir is a daisy chain of historical events, connecting H.G. Wells’ writing of The World Set Free to the creation of the bomb it prophesied. This section is also very well done, although it is more straightforward and minimal in comparison to Benjamin Labatut’s complex webs of connections, and suffers a little for the comparison. I bristled a little at Flanagan’s tendency to assign cause-and-effect (‘a novel destroyed Hiroshima and without Hiroshima there is no me’) to multifactorial events, even while admiring the artistic result.\\n\\nAs someone with a strong bias towards fiction, it comes as a nice surprise that this non-fiction work is my favourite of Flanagan’s books so far. 4.5 stars.\\nShow more', 'Review 3': \"I love this kind of book. I just can't quite tell how much I love this specific one.\\n\\nQuestion 7 is a big, discursive, multidisciplinary chunk of life-writing from Australian author Richard Flanagan, which mixes memoir, literary history, travel writing, and philosophical musings on everything from ethics to colonialism to class.\\n\\nMost of all, perhaps, it's about the contingency of reality – the extreme unlikelihood of having ended up where we are today. Flanagan is only here because his father survived the Japanese POW camps; camps he survived only because the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima; a bomb which was dropped only because physicist Leo Szilard came up with the concept of the nuclear chain reaction; a concept Szilard only came up with because he had read the HG Wells novel The World Set Free; a novel Wells only wrote because he was trying to get over a break-up with his lover Rebecca West; and on and on and on…\\n\\nFlanagan tells all of these stories simultaneously, and the juxtaposition is wildly productive. What emerges is a sense of how the present is jumbled-up with the past and the future, and cannot be disentangled from either of them – something fiction struggles to deal with, he suggests, since ‘all writing is trapped in tenses when life isn't’.\\n\\nWell, possibly. Flanagan slightly loses me when he starts waxing metaphysical; he is strongest when concentrating on the facts, many of those he turns up being new to me and rather surprising. I was amazed, for instance, to find that HG Wells is linked not only to the birth of nuclear weapons (through Szilard), but also to the colonial past of Flanagan's homeland: ‘The War of the Worlds had its genesis in the attempted genocide of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people,’ something which indeed is referenced explicitly in Wells's novel.\\n\\nOn Tasmania Question 7 is excellent, better than many a longer book on the complicated past of that extraordinary island. ‘The Tasmanian story,’ Flanagan says, ‘is the ur-story of the end of the world, much imitated and never rivalled.’ He is particularly excoriating on the tendency of the British to shake their heads (as the Independent newspaper did in 2009) over the fact that ‘white Australians still struggle to come to terms with their colonial past’ – as if, Flanagan fumes,\\n\\n\\nthe genocide was our invention and not theirs, as though the totalitarian slave system was our choice and not their gulag. How marvellous, to have an empire, reap its robbed riches, and yet etch its colonial failings on the colonised, to write on our bodies that we were the vulgar arriviste, the barbarian, the savage, that their judgement was our crime.\\n\\n\\nIt's this colonial awareness of the past that infuses the whole book, giving it a sense of generalised gloomy responsibility. ‘No one is exempt from guilt,’ he says; and, elsewhere, ‘There is no memory without shame.’\\n\\nUnfortunately, Flanagan doesn't confine himself to interesting facts and reflections only, preferring to reach towards something more philosophical and, to my taste, less meaningful. The book takes its title from a short story by Chekhov making fun of exam questions. Chekhov's question seven reads:\\n\\n\\nWednesday, June 17, 1881, a train had to leave station A at 3 a.m. in order to reach station B at 11 p.m.; just as the train was about to depart, however, an order came that the train had to reach station B by 7 p.m. Who loves longer, a man or a woman?\\n\\n\\nFlanagan takes this as emblematic – though of what, I'm still not sure. Of the absurdity of fact, perhaps. He comes back to it in all kinds of contexts where it seems of dubious relevance or taste. The underlying problem is that he's very suspicious (as is clear from some of his fiction) of ‘history’, and he discusses this a little when he talks about his time at Oxford:\\n\\n\\nI studied history, an idea of time formed over 3000 years of human experience in Europe, which, I discovered, made perfect sense of European time, stopping at all the stations of European progress and European thought. […] But it made no sense of Tasmania.\\n\\n\\nThis leads him to denounce the ‘lies we call time, history, reality, memory, detail, facts’. But these things are not the same. Memory may lie, but history and facts are not lies, pretty much by definition – and it's actually of crucial importance to Flanagan's book that they're not, since it's based very specifically on the baffling teleology of how things actually took place. If this is a story of things that may have happened a bit like this or may not, then it has no value at all.\\n\\nBecause the bomb over Hiroshima contained four silk bags of cordite to start the chain reaction, and because the exact death toll is not known, Flanagan finds himself writing: ‘all that can be said with absolute certainty is that soaring as pure energy and vaporised fragments towards the heavens that morning…were four silk powder bags.’ Of course it's not factually true that this is all that can be said about Hiroshima, but nor is it really poetically true either. Later he goes even further:\\n\\n\\nPerhaps the only reply that can be made to Hiroshima is to ask question 7.\\n\\n\\nWell, no, I'm sorry, but this isn't good enough. It's all very well to pontificate that ‘reality is often no more than the enthusiastic answer we give to our dreams and nightmares’, but when it comes to the nuclear bombing of tens of thousands of people, facts matter, and there is in some sense an intellectual duty to recognise what is real and what isn't.\\n\\nStill, in the end, this uneasiness I felt only represents one failing in a book chock-full of successes – a lone misfire in a box of intellectual fireworks. Maybe if I trusted Flanagan more, I would have gone along with it more enthusiastically, but I still often have the sense that he is writing sentences which have the shape of something profound without all the substance.\\n\\nAll the same, there are so many strange and wonderful connections here – between cultures, languages, and time periods – that you can't help but come out of it feeling completely energised.\\nShow more\", 'Review 4': 'A splendid and extraordinary book; one that touched my heart in many ways. It is uncategorizable, part memoir and part history, enhanced with a dollop of autofiction. In brilliant prose, Flanagan addresses some of the most significant themes of the 19th and 20th centuries, while painting loving portraits of his homeland and his parents.\\n\\nThese are the key elements of the book: Flanagan was born on Tasmania. His father was a slave labor POW in Japan during WWII. H.G. Wells had an intense relationship with Rebecca West. In the 1930\\'s, physicist Leo Szilard developed the idea for nuclear chain reactions. And when he was 21, Flanagan almost died in a kayaking accident.\\n\\nFrom these seemingly unrelated facts, Flanagan creates a tribute to Tasmania, sharing his love for the place and also his pain when reflecting on its conflict past, the genocide of its indigenous population, and the destruction of its rainforests. In parallel, he shares deeply loving descriptions of his hardworking parents, different from one another but both representative of Tasmania, witnesses to the changes to the country over the course of the 20th century.\\n\\nThe book captures Flanagan\\'s efforts to understand his place in the world he inherited from them. \"Experience is but a moment. Making sense of that moment is a life.\" He has done this so effectively that it is unsurprising that he previously won the Booker for fiction and now the Baillie Gifford prize for non-fiction.\\n\\nHis message, and the incomparable way in which he expresses it, have affected me profoundly. Not just the sense of a well-told story, but a deeper connection to the beauty and terror of the world we inhabit. This may sound melodramatic, but the truth is that my eyes are filling with tears as I type this. Obviously it won\\'t affect everyone the same way but for me reading it was a remarkable experience.\\n\\nOh yes, about Question 7 of the title. It is taken from this Chekhov parody of a typical examination question:\\n\\n\"Wednesday, June 17, 1881, a train had to leave station A at 3am in order to reach station B at 11pm; just as the train was about to depart, however, an order came that the train had to reach station B by 7pm. Who loves longer, a man or a woman?\"\\nShow more', 'Review 5': \"As someone who has read all of Flanagan's earlier books, I was initially a little puzzled by this one. It seemed to be retracing previous ground. He had dealt with his near-death experience when he almost drowned in the Franklin River in fictional form in Death of a River Guide (1994), where the death of the titular character forms the frame for rest of the novel. His Booker Prize winner, The Narrow Road to the Deep North (2013) was clearly both inspired and informed by the experiences of his father Arch as a POW and slave labourer in Burma and Japan. And he drew on his experience of the death of his mother Helen in The Living Sea of Waking Dreams (2021). So I wondered why he decided to return to examine all three of these elements in his life in this memoir. But more puzzling were the other focuses of the book. What did Chekov's short stories, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the life of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard and the love affair between H.G. Wells and Rebecca West have to do with Flanagan's biography?\\n\\nBut I knew how Flanagan can weave a story, so I trusted he would bring these seemingly totally unconnected elements together. And he does. The result is a deeply thoughtful, lyrical, often raw and profoundly wise meditation on life, death and love.\\n\\nThe connections between the elements I initially found odd and how they relate to the lives of Flanagan and his parents and their respective deaths comes slowly into view and is finally fully interwoven in the ninth chapter. In an age of bestselling lowbrow celebrity autobiographies, this is genuine philosophical memoir and a mature writer mustering his powers at their height to turn and confront some grim and painful aspects of his life that he had previously kept at bay though the distance of fictional treatment. The climax of this is the final section, which gives a detailed, harrowing and genuinely terrifying account of his near-drowning as a young man. This is something he tells us he had previously never fully confronted and the catharsis of his writing makes the impact of this ending to the book all the more moving.\\n\\nI once wrote a short (affectionate) parody of Flanagan's fiction, which featured a bloke seeing visions of drunken possums and wallabies in a Hobart pub and then going outside to die in the rain. Some of his fiction can come across as very grim and often melancholic. This is quite a contrast to seeing or hearing the author speak or give interviews, where his gentle, wry and self-effacing good humour is very clear; Flanagan, in person, is very funny. Perhaps it's because I listened to the audio book of Question 7 (read by the author himself) while on a series of long drives, but that kindly humour shines through far more clearly in this work.\\n\\nThe result of this combination of humour, erudition, meditation, perspective and raw honesty is, in the end, genuine wisdom. I hope we get many more books from Richard Flanagan, but this one will certainly remain one of his very best.\\nShow more\", 'Review 6': 'This memoir is about all the chain reactions and circles of life, how one event leads to another event and back. It’s about Richard Flanagan’s mother and father, and family. It’s about Tasmania and history and genocide and convicts and nature and all those influences. It’s also about his father’s experience as a prisoner of the Japanese, as a slave worker in a coal mine in Japan when the bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. If that hadn’t happened his father would probably have died in Japan and so he’d never have been born. So the memoir goes back to HG Wells and his relationship with Rebecca West and the writing of the book The World Set Free and his imagined invention the atomic bomb. There’s much more about the scientific developments as it’s such a major event and the scientists involved, mainly Leo Szilard. The book finishes with Flanagan’s near death experience in the Franklin River.\\nThis is beautifully written and I found it incredibly hard to put down. I enjoyed reading about his experiences at Oxford for instance. The stories about his family are moving and heartfelt. I loved it.\\nShow more', 'Review 7': 'Winner of the Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction, worthily so and great to see a novel winning that prize.\\n\\nAnd so, once more, a disappointing reality was reinvented as a fiction that metamorphosed into an unexpected new reality.\\n\\nQuestion 7 is the fifth of Richard Flanagan\\'s books I\\'ve read, and confirms him as a fascinating, if inconsistent, author - the other four being:\\n\\nGould\\'s Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish - fascinating in literary terms and a physically beautiful work which, with its use of different coloured inks, has clear echoes in Nicola Barker’s 2017 Goldsmiths Prize winning H(A)PPY;\\n\\nThe Narrow Road to the Deep North - overly safe and conventional (and did you know he finished it the day his father died - surprised he didn\\'t mention that in any interviews);\\n\\nFirst Person - a very creative work, one where Flanagan perhaps used the device of his story to settle a few too many scores and drag in a little too much personal history; and\\n\\nThe Living Sea of Waking Dreams - \"One of the most spectacularly incoherent novels ever to reach print\" to quote Brian Stableford on Bram Stoker’s Lair of the White Worm, but deliberately so and in a so-bad-its-good way.\\n\\nNaturally the Booker chose to reward much the least ambitious of these, The Narrow Road to the Deep North being one of the weaker winners of the prize. But with Question 7, this year\\'s jury have a chance to make a bolder decision and recognise this hybrid work as the novel, if a novel with little fiction, which I think it is. Flanagan himself teases as the nature of the work in one of his epigraphs which quotes a review of Moby Dick: The author has not given his effort here the benefit of knowing whether it is history, autobiography, gazetteer, tragedy, romance, almanac, melodrama, or fantasy. It may be myriad, it may not. The\\xa0question is put, but where is the answer?\\n\\nIndeed Question 7 as a novel is an exemplar of what Javier Cercas, in Anne McLean\\'s translation, described in The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel:\\n\\nThe novel is not the genre of answers, but that of questions: writing a novel consists of posing a complex question in order to formulate it in the most complex way possible, not to answer it, or not to answer it in a clear and unequivocal way; it consists of immersing oneself in an enigma to render it insoluble, not to decipher it (unless rendering it insoluble is, precisely, the only way to decipher it). That enigma is the blind spot, and the best things these novels have to say they say by way of it: by way of that silence bursting with meaning, that visionary blindness, that radiant darkness, that ambiguity without solution. That blind spot is what we are.\\n\\n\\nAnd Flanagan\\'s question is Question 7 as posed by Chekhov in the story Questions Posed by a Mad Mathematician as translated by Peter Constantine:\\n\\n7. Wednesday, June 17, 1881, a train had to leave station A at 3am in order to reach station B at 11pm.; just as the train was about to depart, however, an order came from that the train had to reach station B by 7pm. Who loves longer, a man or a woman?\\n\\n\\nHis lack of an answer traces a path from the the near successful genocide of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population, through to the novels of H.G. Wells and his love affair with Rebecca West, through to Leo Szilard, the Manhatten Project and the bomb that ends the war before the PoW camps in Japan could end Flanagan\\'s father\\'s life:\\n\\nWe cannot be what we cannot dream. And sometimes we discover that we live in the dreams and nightmares of others and we dream anew. I only write this book that you are now reading, no more than a love note to my parents and my island home, a world that has vanished, because over a century ago another writer wrote a book that decades later seized another mind with such force that it became a reality that reshaped the world. It was a story of horror that was his fear of love, complete love without measure or boundary, and he created in its place an idea of destruction without limit. In this way, the world begat a book that would in turn beget the world.\\n\\nWithout Rebecca West’s kiss H. G. Wells would not have run off to Switzerland to write a book in which everything burns, and without H. G. Wells’s book Leo Szilard would never have conceived of a\\xa0nuclear chain reaction and without conceiving of a nuclear\\xa0chain\\xa0reaction he would never have grown terrified and without growing terrified Leo Szilard would never have persuaded Einstein to lobby Roosevelt and without Einstein lobbying Roosevelt there would have no Manhattan Project and without the Manhattan Project there is no lever at 8.15 am on 6 August 1945 for Thomas Ferebee to release 31,000 feet over Hiroshima, there is no bomb on Hiroshima and no bomb on Nagasaki and 100,000 people or 160,000 people or 200,000 people live and my father dies. Poetry may make nothing happen, but a novel destroyed Hiroshima and without Hiroshima there is no me and these words erase themselves and\\xa0me\\xa0with\\xa0them.\\n\\nBut that is to imply a linear causuality that is the opposite of what Flanagan wishes to suggest. He acknowledges the influence of this essay by Siena Stubbs, which suggests a fourth tense in Yolŋu:\\n\\n\\nIt’s what is happening now. This has always happened, is happening and will happen in the future. Yolŋu people have always sat/are sitting/will always sit under the shaded resting place named Buṉumbirr at this place and were thinking/are thinking/will think about the fish that they will catch later in the day.\\n\\nListen to the sound of Bunbuyŋu Miyarama (the ancestors’ voices) …\\nthe sound of the Miliwurrwurr (Rirratjiŋu clan) people talking…\\nanticipating the sweet taste of the fish.\\n\\nThe past is in the present is in the future. Our ancestors were here, are here and will be here, waiting for the tide to go out so the fish can be caught. Yambirrpa has always provided fish for Yolŋu people and it will continue to.\\n\\n\\nAnd as Flanagan concludes on the morality or otherwise of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan:\\n\\nWhat if vengeance and atonement both are simply the lie that time can be reversed, and thereby some equality, some equilibrium, some justice had? Is it simply truer to say Hiroshima happened, Hiroshima is still happening, and Hiroshima will\\xa0always\\xa0happen?\\n\\nA brilliantly conceived work. There\\'s a lot packed in to its relatively modest page count, and some elements will work better or less well for different readers - for me the role of HG Wells in the chain reaction of events most fascinating, although other parts of the Manhatten Project very well trodden territory, the political discussions on Tasmanian and the role of the Martians (the English) most thought provoking, and the family memoir skippable (hence the 4 not 5 stars).\\n\\nTo end with a fascinating fact of my own, not in the novel. H G Wells visited Australia in late 1938 / early 1939. The then Australian PM, I believe the only Tasmanin to ever hold the post, criticised him for his speeches there as he has “so far indulged his well-known political sympathies as to make disparaging remarks about the leaders of other nations”. Those leaders about which Wells\\xa0was\\xa0so\\xa0rude\\xa0… Hitler and Mussolini. And of course the PM himself was largely echoing the appeasement policy that still prevailed in the UK, a policy some might argue that was all about preservation of the colonies.\\n\\nThanks to the publisher via Netgalley for the ARC.\\nShow more', 'Review 8': 'I devoured this book in 24 hours.

Es una impresión, que se me ha confirmado con Question 7, que tal como él dice en esta primera cita convierte en una carta de amor a sus padres y a Tasmania, pero su habilidad está quizás no tanto en la historia en sí sino en la forma en que consigue traspasar y conectar: \"And so at the beginning I learnt this: the words of a book are never the book, the soul of it is everything\". \"El mar vivo de los sueños despiertos\" me tocó porque la sentí muy cercana e igual me he sentido con esta Question 7: doscientas y pico páginas que son una mezcla de memoria personal y famliar, filosofía personal, biografía, historia novelizada y reflexión sobre la creación artistica. Los textos de Flanagan me parecen siempre muy verdaderos, muy cercanos e íntimos, consiguen conmoverme hasta el punto de que me veo identificada y retratada en muchos momentos: “Its in fragments that we find ourselves”. En Question 7, por ejemplo, son especialmente conmovedores los momentos en los que Flanagan habla de sus padres, se retrotrae a experiencias familiares del pasado y los enfrenta a la visión que tiene de ellos cuando ya se han hecho mayores, los convierte en momentos tan íntimos como universales. Es de los pocos autores ahora mismo que se ve muy verdadero y personal, y esto es quizás debido a este estilo tan práctico y poético al mismo tiempo.\\n\\n\\n\"And when she was leaving we somehow ended up sitting in her car and she spoke of how difficult our father was, how since his retirement he would sort out her cupboards and drawers expressing dissatisfaction with the way she kept them.

Sin embargo, aquí en Question 7, Flanagan no lo noveliza, sino que se aproxima desde el punto de vista de un niño que siempre detectó la profunda huella que aquella experiencia había dejado en su padre, aunque sin encontrar explicación a un cierto comportamiento de un padre que buscaba siempre la soledad, porque su padre nunca habló de su profundo dolor aunque Flanagan ya como adulto indagó en él. Esta experiencia como prisionero/esclavo de guerra también marcará al hijo que ya de adulto recorrerá los mismos lugares e incluso llegará a encontrarse con personas que vivieron la misma experiencia de su padre para llegar a entender ese trauma. Flanagan lo cuenta a flor de piel, pero las mejores páginas de este texto serán aquellos en los nos contará como son ellos, sus padres ya en su vejez.\\n\\n\\n\"It was clear to me even when I was very young that my father was different, that he had passed through something, but what that something was wasn\\'t really talked about.

When the subject was sad or serious, he would smile wanly, his face turning inside out, a concertina of wrinkles compressing his eyes into wry sunken currants, and from him would flow a riversong of stories.\"\\n\\n\\n- Otra de las lineas argumental hace referencia a la colonización de Tasmania, esa colonización europea sobre los aborígenes de Tasmania que marcaron un genoicidio en sí mismo y que Flanagan conectará con su propia familia y con sus posible sangre aborígen.\\n\\n\\n\"Is It because we see our world only darkly that we surround ourselves with líes we call time, history, reality, memory, detail, facts?\"\\n\\n\\n- Y en el tercer hilo argumental, que podría haber sido el primero, Flanagan hace surgir a HG Wells a través de su novela The world set free conectándola con la historia de Hiroshima, ya que en esta novela en la que todo estalla, Wells predice la guerra nuclear años antes de que siquiera comenzaran las investigaciones hablando de un arma destructiva que lo arrasaría todo a su paso. ¿Y cómo decide Flanagan conectar la historia de Hiroshima, que le interesa contar porque además estará intimamente relacionada con la experiencia de su padre con la del escritor HG Wells? Pues usará el encuentro entre HG Wells y Rebecca West, como momento de inflexión, lo conectados que se sintieron desde el primer momento, pero de quién en un principio Wells huyó: \"Meanwhile, Rebecca West was writing of how she could\\'nt conceive of a person who ran about lighting bonfires but feared the flame. Yet that was HG Wells. But he did not want someone like her, who burnt.\" El momento justo, imagino que totalmente novelizado dentro de la historia real, en el que Wells besa a Rebecca West frente al escaparate de una librería, será el momento decisivo que hará surgir la novela que luego escribiría. Tras el beso a Rebecca West, Wells, hombre casado, huye aterrado a refugiarse en los Alpes suizos a escribir la novela The world set free. Igual sin este beso/huida a Suiza escapando del terror que le producía enamorarse de la escritora, nunca se habría escrito este libro que predijo el cataclismo de la bomba atómica. “Fiction may be only fancy yet reality is often no more than the enthusiastic answer we give to our deams and nightmares.” La realidad no deja de ser un espejo surgida de la ficción, de nuestros sueños y pesadillas...\\n\\n\\n“They should never have met, they were destined for each other, he would make her life and destroy her life and she would make her life in spite of his life, he would be an inexhaustible source of love and friendship for her for the next 35 years, he would madden her, he would win her and lose her and win her, she would be the one person he cared to see to the end.\\n\\nRebecca West and HG Wells were completely wrong for each other, they were completely right; she saw he wouldn\\'t leave his wife, he saw he needed a wife. He thought love was just common sense, she thought it was a way of losing It, he was for sex without love, she was for the whole damn business. He believed he was reinventing literature as a form of proselytising journalism, while she wrote many years after their affaire ended, as still arguing with him, that art was not a plaything, but a necessity, and the book she wrote , Black Lamb Grey Falcon, reinvented journalism as literature, prefiguring much of what literature would become.\\n\\nShe discovered very early that her chief strenght as a writer was that she wrote as she felt whereas most writers only write as others think. Along with her new name she stole from Ibsen the thoroughly non English idea that ideas make the world spin around...\"\\n\\n\\nRichard Flanagan usa técnicas novelescas para vincular a Wells con su amante y futura pareja, Rebecca West, y con Lee Szilard, cuya lectura de la novela de Wells le hizo ser el primero en darse cuenta de que el poder nuclear podía usarse para hacer una bomba de proporciones aterradoras, la reacción nuclear en cadena, y esta idea se convertirá en un concepto recurrente a lo largo de toda esta obra, así que la novela de Wells será el punto inicial que marcará el comienzo de Hiroshima. Todo está conectado, interrelacionado y una cosa siempre llevará a la otra. De la misma manera que en que está conectado el mundo, así Flanagan conectará Tasmania y el genocidio de los aborígenes, con el internamiento de su padre en los durísimos campos de prisioneros de guerra en el sudeste asiático construyendo una reflexión muy personal, poética y muy lúcida sobre la vida, la memoria, sus ancestros, la huella que la violencia y los traumas dejarán en nosotros: \"Does time heal? Time does not always heal. Time scars.\" Reconozco en Richard Flanagan un escritor único, que no se parece a nadie y el modo en que explora los momentos más duros y devastadores de la humanidad mimetizándolos con los personales igual de traumáticos, están exponiendo claramente que cuando algo ocurre, no solo se ha convertido en parte del pasado sino que sigue siendo parte de nuestro futuro, nada desaparece: la necesidad de olvidar es tan fuerte como la necesidad de recordar, incluso más poderosa...\\n\\n\\n\"As if the need to forget is as strong as the need to remember. Perhaps stronger.\\n\\nAnd after oblivion? We return to the stories we call our memories, perplexed, strangers to the ongoing invention that is our life.\"\\n\\n\\nEl titulo de esta obra proviene de un cuento de Chéjov, “Pregunta de un matemático loco”, una especie de parodia de un problema de matemáticas escolar. La pregunta 7 es: El miércoles 17 de junio de 1881, un tren tenía que salir de la estación A a las 3 de la mañana para llegar a la estación B a las 11 de la noche; sin embargo, justo cuando el tren estaba a punto de partir, llegó una orden de que el tren debía llegar a la estación B a las 7 de la tarde. ¿Quién ama más, un hombre o una mujer?\\n\\n\\n¿Quién ama más? Será una pregunta recurrente a lo largo de esta obra. Chéjov/Flanagan nos está enfrentando al hecho de no detenernos en lo superficial y mirar más allá de la lógica y la racionalidad de este mundo porque su lógica siempre va a resultar imprevista y surgirá otro nivel que no sabíamos que existía y que probablemente sea la auténtica realidad aunque no la percibamos a simple vista porque vivimos en un mundo de apariencias y existe esa otra realidad que es la de verdad pero que no vemos. Una pregunta sin respuesta, pero Chéjov creía que el papel de la literatura no era dar respuestas sino plantear preguntas necesarias, solo los tontos creen tener las respuestas. Se puede decir que hay otra linea argumental más soterrada y escondida que habla de los ancestros donde Flanagan se detiene en el concepto del tiempo, todo tiempo puede coexistir, los antepasados que estuvieron aquí, seguirán estando aquí: “Life is always happening and has happened and will happen…”. En definitiva, un texto absolutamente devastador, lúcido, y conmovedor. Eso sí, yo lo leería como una extensión de “El mar vivo de los sueños despiertos”\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps the only reply that can be made to Hiroshima is to ask question 7. If it is a question that can never be answered, it is still the question we must keep asking, if only in order to understand that life is never binary, nor reducible to cant or code, but a mystery we must aprehend. In Chekhovs stories, the only fools are those with answers.\\n\\n\"Chekhov wrote question 7 is about how the world from which we presume to derive meaning and purpose is not the true world. It is a surface world, a superficial world, a frozen world of appearances, beneath which an entirely different world surges as if a wild river that any moment might drown us.\"\\n\\n♫♫♫ Bright Horses - Nick Cave ♫♫♫\\nShow more'}\n",

I’m incredibly disappointed that I didn’t enjoy this latest read. I wanted to leave having gained greater understanding of how to untangle emotions, but felt it just barely hit the surface of emotions and advice we’re always given (I.e. “it’s okay to feel emotions”). Some of the illustrations were used in prior books and felt cringy, even though I’m sure she got permission from family/friends to use them. I wanted depth like her previous reads and didn’t feel that connection.

It was very healing & validating for me in so many ways. ♥️', 'Review 3': 'I\\'d like to start my review by saying that I think Allen\\'s heart for this topic is so important. The American church has been known to belittle or even vilify emotions to a non-biblical extent. I\\'m rating this book 3 stars because I don\\'t think there was anything inherently wrong in it. (Although I didn\\'t love the use of the word \"joy\" as a starting point for all positive emotions but... semantics.)\\n\\nUnfortunately I found this book promising lots and delivering little. I kept waiting for new revelations from the content, but it all felt very basic. There was also little scripture to be found for the points that were made. While I agreed with a lot of what she said, I can not think of a new concept I learned or new perspective I was shown.\\n\\nThere were multiple times in this book that Jennie mentions wishing she should have a cup of coffee with the reader to hear their story in relation to the topic at hand. With this, I think she illustrates the problem I had with this book, that it is too broad and surface-level to invite much conversation or deep thought. Overall, I think it would have made a much better podcast subject or long-form essay.\\n\\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC of this book.

We were both balling our eyes out (especially in the beginning), and I was so wowed by the relatability and perspective she brought to this. As someone (like most people) with trauma, this was so eye opening as Jennie outlined how our emotions are connectors to God and one another, and how each emotion is a unique way to let God work in us. We always have a choice in what we do with all of our emotions, and they are not sins in and of themselves unless we act on them negatively. It's no joke that this book has seriously changed my life, my relationship with God, and my relationships with my family. Lots of note taking commenced while reading, which is generally not something I do unless it's THAT GOOD. I highly highly highly recommend reading this: it couldn't be more timely or well-needed for the times we find ourselves in and in a society so overwhelmed and inundated with mental health crises and so many voices on what to do with it all.

      "{'Review 1': 'Yes, But Who Am I?\\n\\n“Whiskey Tender” is Deborah Jackson Taffa’s search for her identity as a mixed tribe native girl. Her father is Quechan/Laguna, and her mother is a devout Hispanic Catholic. This is not a story of a girl soaking in the stories handed down by her family, she had to fight through their reluctance to speak of the things they had endured: tales of the treatment suffered in the Indian residential boarding schools and, as she said, “...the shame: the silence that follows an apocalypse.”\\n\\nIn addition to the struggles for support within the family, her identity was beset by social confusion. Born on the Yuma, California Reservation, the family moved to Farmington, New Mexico, where her father could find the work he was trained for. Leaving the reservation was tantamount to betrayal or desertion in the eyes of her father’s people. Farmington is on the northeast border of the Navajo Nation and there was a resistance against full acceptance of Quechan blood and tradition. The Hispanic population did not see Deborah’s family as their own, either. As for the white attitude, Farmington had just been the scene of protests following the “Indian rolling” kidnapping and murdering of three native men by three high school students.\\n\\nThis confusing attempt to grasp identity while being sent mixed signals reminded me of “If I Survive You” by Jonathan Escoffery, a novel shortlisted for the 2023 Booker Prize. A main theme of that book involves the denial of acceptance by those the protagonist is drawn to. Escoffery’s character is a young Jamaican immigrant, rejected by Jamaican islanders just as soundly as he is rejected by every other group in his new home.\\n\\nThis is a fascinating portrait of where Native Americans look to find themselves today, told through one woman’s coming of age in an America which has tried so hard to whitewash out her heritage. I love the relationship she conveys with her father. I am touched by the distance she and her mother try so hard to bridge. A wonderful book addressing life from the family to the nation.\\n\\nThank you to Harper Books and NetGalley for providing an advance reader copy in exchange for an honest review. #WhiskeyTender #NetGalley\\n\\n***Acknowledged by author on X / Twitter...\\nDeborah Jackson Taffa\\n@deborahtaffa\\nThanks for the dream comparison to\\n@J_Escoffery\\n, Michael! I’m a huge fan of his work! 💙\\n\\nHow great is that!\\nShow more', 'Review 2': 'Interesting meditations from a Native American memoirist and writer about retaining one’s heritage culture while facing pressures to assimilate to the dominant group. Deborah Jackson Taffa writes with unfiltered honesty about the sometimes complicated and sometimes simple dynamics of her family, the white supremacist violence faced by members of the Native community, and her own coming of age amidst different cultural and social factors. While the writing in this memoir sometimes felt a bit slow or uneven to me, I recognize this book’s importance within the broader literary canon.\\nShow more', 'Review 3': 'Everyone should read this book. Or listen to it, as I did. The narrator did such a fantastic job bringing the story to life, I adored her narration. I know she\\'s also in Wandering Stars which is one of my next listens and another few books on my tbr. I can\\'t wait to hear more from her.\\n\\nIn Whiskey Tender we follow Deborah, as she grows up, not really sure where she belongs. We get to know her, her family, her tribal traditions and even learn some history along the way.\\n\\nI was already familiar with the history, but I love that it was included. Especially in such a skillful way where it compliments the story instead of being a \"random\" block of historical text in the middle of storytelling.\\n\\nWhat I never really thought about, is that a tribe may not have many traditions or know about them, and how that might feel for members of said tribe. Taffa tackles that in the book very well.\\n\\nAlso, seeing how she was treated for not being a part of the dominant tribe in the area, or being native in general was very eye opening.\\n\\nAgreeing with everyone who said this should be in school (and all) libraries. It\\'s simply a must read.\\nShow more', 'Review 4': 'Rounding up to four. I probably should’ve read this in pieces. It was a lot of trauma to read through in one sitting. It was an important story to read, and I suspect that it’s a very common one among the Indigenous, especially because colonizing the Americas was not a one time event, that there are other forms of more insidious and legalized genocides occurring still, and because it happened/is still happening on every continent. On top of that, the Indigenous people of today are still suffering from the generational trauma they’ve been inheriting ever since and will continue to pass down, because even if they ever find their way out of disenfranchisement, there is so much damage to work through. It would take maybe two or three times as long to undo and rebuild any semblance of health and peace at any level. Until then, we have to make a collective effort to make sure their stories are never forgotten, even as they are actively being erased from US textbooks today (thanks to MAGA denial of facts).\\nShow more', 'Review 5': '(Note: I received an advanced reader copy of this book courtesy of NetGalley)\\n\\nI honestly don’t know where to start on everything that I was able to learn thanks to Deborah Tafa’s personal narrative and the way that it seamlessly blends her personal story and family history with plentiful amounts of general Native American history and Native American history pertaining specifically to the American southwest. Whisky Tender ended up providing quite the hefty education that I immediately valued immensely, speaking as someone whose own education about indigenous Americans wasn’t so much an education as it was a nearly total lack of one. I appreciated the way that Taffa managed to expose my now-glaring knowledge gaps on numerous indigenous-related matters that I wasn’t even aware of before promptly proceeding to give me a helpful foundation to filling them in.\\n\\nHowever, even if by some miracle I had been able to go into this book already completely up to date on the aforementioned, I would have treasured reading it all the same. It’s a beautifully honest and open memoir about growing up and trying to navigate the sharp disconnect between a white-centric mainstream culture, the so-called American dream and her own native identity. Also, speaking as a descendant of European settlers and immigrants - the country as Taffa has lived it and as I have lived it so far have been extremely different experiences (and that’s such an understatement that it almost feels like a crime), and it’s not often that I get the valuable opportunity to get at least a glimpse into this part of America, much less one so very deeply intimate.\\n\\nWhisky Tender is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2023, and one of my favorite reads of the year in general - and in my opinion, it’s now an absolute must-have for the shelves of my local public library and the academic library where I work.\\nShow more', 'Review 6': \"It's always strange to rate a memoir, when it's basically about someone's life and memories, right? But thankfully, I really liked this and got emotional a few times. It only covers Jackson Taffa's childhood and teenage years, so I would call it a coming-of-age memoir. It's deeply concerned with roots and the trauma and twisting of living in a majority culture that's white (supermacist), catholic, capitalist.\\n\\nA lot of tragedy is depicted in the book (quite a lot of tragedy for a book that covers 18 or so years of life), but I have to admit that the moments that got to me most where the small ones, the little losses, the little victories of the system over the author. Like the relationship with one of the catholic nun / teachers at school and how Deborah Jackson Taffa really wanted her academic approval. The moments where I was feeling it more deeply were also the ones where she started to rebel and give herself agency in the world, instead of (understandably) trying so hard to fit into the majority culture.\\n\\nJackson Taffa, as a child and teenager, is constantly pulled in different directions, trying to connect to her Indigenous roots via her father and other Indigenous people around, but also trying to live with her own mother, Mexican and catholic, who wants her children to share in her religion and also pass as white. The complexity of this situation was realy well-rendered in the book and lead to plenty of painful, but also joyful moments.\\n\\nOnce again, weird to say this about a memoir, but at times I felt the pacing was a bit off, or too slow, or too detailed. And I couldn't connect to the book as deeply as I would have liked. Still, a really great story about the emptiness of the genocidal American Dream, figuring that out, and then forging your own path ahead.\\n\\n20/31 reads in 31 days in January.\\nShow more\", 'Review 7': 'Deborah Taffa’s gorgeous memoir “Whiskey Tender” brims with life. And death. And dreams.\\n\\nIcama, as Taffa explains early in the book, is a core belief of the Quechuan people in Southwest America. It is a respect and belief that one’s dreams can act as a guide towards civic responsibility, personal goals, spiritual power, as well as an interaction with the souls of the dead.\\n\\nAt the beginning of Part 1, Taffa sets up the present context of being fifty years old and driving with her father to her mother’s funeral and falling “into a sandstorm dream.” They are going home to their reservation in Yuma, CA, where Taffa and her family lived during her early childhood. As I read, I too feel into the dream of the book, the characters came alive as they protected and pulled away from each other; as the journeys towards and away from home were immersion in cultures, neighborhoods, towns and their ancient and urban ways; as dreams weaved in and out of a physical and material reality that invited me in and stunned me with its vividness. Life and death intertwine and sadness looms and envelopes. Full of specificity and immediacy, the book is about family, colonialism, the extractionary harshness of whiteness, the struggle of communities to stay together and not knowing what helps or hinders that togetherness. Overall, there is no turning away from the wrenching realities of living on and away from a family’s ancestral land.\\n\\nThis is a coming of age memoir spanning the time from Taffa’s birth to her graduating from high school in Farmington, NM in the 1980s. Her father is Quechan/Laguna and her mother is Hispanic; and both of them come from families with deep roots in New Mexico. Taffa is a magical storyteller. She resurrects, for the reader, the large families on both sides—full of siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents that both her parents bring into their union. There are differences in religious practices, although Taffa’s paternal grandmother who held a mixture of tribal and Christian beliefs gives an insight into how they can be merged into a spiritual life. As she grows, Taffa encounters and confronts spaces and individuals where religion plays a central role. She goes to a convent school where nuns and other teachers hold on to the punitive power of Christianity over the native communities. As a child, she attends a funeral after the early and tragic death of her uncle and aunt where the ceremony in the Cry House and the cremation of bodies over the cottonwood branches reminded me of my own family’s Hindu practice of mourning. Taffa’s mother is a devout Catholic who says the rosary and takes her little girls to mass every morning but also ignores the wisdom of the native ways that Taffa seeks out.\\n\\nTaffa’s father is a mighty presence in the book. Taffa is honest and clear about his difficult beginnings and his run-ins with the law and time in jail when he was a teenager. As the book progresses, he trains to be a welder, gets a stable job at the Four Corners power plant, and becomes the first Indian foreman in the history of the plant. He coaches softball when Taffa and her siblings are younger, exposes the kids to contemporary culture, tells them stories of growing up rough on the Yuma reservation, and as she grows, encourages Taffa to make her own choices and to figure out what it means for her to be an individual. He is sharp, tough, and grounded but also kind and supportive.\\n\\nThroughout, we see the Southwest landscape through Taffa’s eyes – the Colorado river that runs through the Yuma reservation, the Animas river where her family goes fishing, the cacti and sage plants, the sandstone lands and the desert canyons, the ravens and eagles, juniper and cottonwood trees, the sun rising over the bluffs and boulders. As a teenager, she gets up early and hikes in her favorite canyon by herself. I loved to imagine her walking and thinking about all that she was beginning to confront in her young life. In addition to the angst most youngsters feel, Taffa has a lot coming at her from different directions – a deep longing to learn from her ancestors and to help with the Quechan community, a need for friendship with native people her age, a desire to puzzle out the intersections of history and country, a wrestling with how she could speak up about injustice.\\n\\nLate in the book, Taffa has a dream while driving back home with her family, after her sister survives a terrible car accident. She writes about the dream: “...my ancestors were running across the desert. They were leaping over washes and climbing up boulders with supernatural speed—and they were pulling me alongside them. At first I thought we were trying to escape, but then I realized we were running toward rather than away, and the dream became beautiful.”\\nShow more', 'Review 8': 'An honest exploration of identity, Whiskey Tender pulled on my heartstrings as an Indigenous/Mexican woman. While Taffa’s stories weren’t fully relatable to me, they made me long for the loss of my culture as I was raised to “fit in” to White American.', 'Review 9': '5 stars. Excellent.', 'Review 10': 'I am so grateful to Deborah Taffa for gifting us with Whiskey Tender and her life story. Taffa is my age, and yet her formative years were so different from my own - growing up \"half-breed\" with grandparents who were born to the Quechan Nation and Laguna Pueblo tribe, a mother who was raised Catholic, and a father raised in the Native American traditions. From the perspective of a girl growing up among so many different worlds, Taffa explores the difficult issues of reconciliation, assimilation, segregation and tradition. This memoir is educative and evocative and an important addition to an ugly (and still unresolved) chapter of American history.\\nShow more'}\n",
